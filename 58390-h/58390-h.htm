<h2>
PREFACE
</h2>

<p>
In this volume I have endeavoured to present a review in
chronological order of the important events which contributed
to breaking the Wilderness that so long lay untamed
west of the Mississippi, mentioning with as much detail as
possible in a single popular volume the principal persons and
happenings in proper sequence, but paying special attention to
the trapper and trader element, which, more than any other,
dispelled the mysteries of the vast region.
</p>

<p>
I believe this to be the first book so fully to treat the subject
as a consecutive narrative. By means of it, not only may
the story of the struggle to master the Wilderness be examined,
but the place of the trapper and trader in the work of its reduction,
and that of Coronado, Mackenzie, Lewis and Clark,
Frémont, Powell, and similar explorers, may be determined
with reference to each other as well as with reference to the
general order.
</p>

<p>
Many people seem to know little about Western history;
about Coronado, Cabeza de Vaca, or even about Mackenzie;
and others are by no means clear as to where in the historical
scale these characters belong. While the name of Daniel
Boone is familiar to every child, names of men equally eminent
in the same pursuits, like Jedediah Smith, Bridger, Fitzpatrick,
etc., are scarcely known at all. Nor have many persons a just
appreciation of the numerous attempts that were made to explore
the Western Wilderness, or of the extremely early period
in the history of North America when these attempts began.
Many are surprised, therefore, to learn that the first European
entrance into the western part of the United States occurred
over three and a quarter centuries ago. At least partly, this
vagueness is due to the one-sidedness up to the present of the
usual works dealing with American history, most of which are
only histories of the eastern part of the country, with mere
offhand references to the important events of the region beyond
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_vi' name='Page_vi' href='#Page_vi'>vi</a></span>
the Mississippi. Numerous details are presented of early Virginia
and of New England, but the happenings in New Mexico
and in California, and the great West generally, are dismissed
with a few superficial notes.
</p>

<p>
Within the last year or two much has been written about
Lewis and Clark, and consequently their grand exploit is well
known, but its relation in the popular mind as to accomplishment
and position with reference to other explorations is
often quite uncertain. It therefore appeared to me that a
single volume which should tell the Wilderness story in unbroken
sequence, with special emphasis on the trapper and
trader, would be of value. I have consequently shown the first
attacks by sea and land, and the gradual closing in on all sides,
through the matchless trail-breaking of the trappers and traders,
down to the year when Powell practically finished this particular
white man's task by his bold and romantic conquest of the
Colorado,—the year when the first railway trains crossing the
continent began a new era. In order that the subject might
be still clearer and more comprehensive, I have gone farther
and have told the story of the chief denizens of the pristine
Wilderness: the beaver, the buffalo, and their close associates,
those indomitable, iron-nerved people, the Amerinds; the
North-Americans of yesterday.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it is difficult to describe with precision the route
of an explorer without searching his original story, and, in my
studies, this has not always been practicable. For example, I
do not know where the journals of Hunt and Bonneville now
are, if extant. Irving's interpretation seems fairly accurate,
but as he was entirely unfamiliar with the region west of the
Rocky Mountains, his description is not always clear. In
other cases, especially in that of Verendrye, I have relied on
the transcripts of others. The trail of Coronado I have long
studied with special care, and I have reached the conclusions
embodied in the map on <a href="#i-144">page 115</a>,—conclusions entirely at
variance with all accepted authorities, but which I feel confident,
nevertheless, are in the main correct.
</p>

<p>
One early explorer in the Minnesota and Hudson Bay
regions I have not mentioned. This is Radisson, who, it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_vii' name='Page_vii' href='#Page_vii'>vii</a></span>
claimed, saw the upper Mississippi before Marquette. The
omission was an oversight. Miss A. C. Laut has given a convincing
account of his travels in her <i>Pathfinders of the West</i>, to
which I take pleasure in referring the reader for information
on this point.<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
A completed book is the mirror of the writer's shortcomings.
I hope the reflections which may fall to my lot in this
one will not be too painful, for I have had in contemplation
others to fill in a general scheme. One starts with a desire for
perfection, but without the resources of a Carnegie he is apt
to fall so far short of the mark that he fears to look in the glass
at all.
</p>

<p>
With the Wilderness, however, I can claim some degree of
familiarity, for I may be said to have been "in at the death,"
as I was one of Powell's companions down the Colorado on his
second voyage, 1871-72, and have been over portions of almost
every one of the principal historical trails. I have travelled
there on foot, on horseback, by boat, by waggon, and by railway,—even
by Pullman "Palace" car. I have lived under its
open sky through summers and through winters; its snows, its
rains, its burning heat, have baptised me one of its children.
In some cases my footsteps have been among the first of our
race to break the surface; and if I have not visited every nook
and corner of it during the last thirty four years it is the fault
of my purse, not of my spirit.
</p>

<p>
My remarks on supplying whiskey to the natives may by
some be deemed too severe, but in my own opinion there is no
expression of condemnation adequate to denounce the debauchment
of the American tribes by this foul means. It was a crime
against civilisation, against humanity; a cruel, dastardly outrage
against these people who by its means largely have been
reduced to the lowest degree and are sneered at by those who
have profited by their debasement. In the final chapter I have
thought it desirable to add a footnote to the effect that I am
neither a teetotaler nor a prohibitionist for the reason that my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_viii' name='Page_viii' href='#Page_viii'>viii</a></span>
condemnatory remarks might otherwise be attributed to the
prejudice of zeal, rather than to indignation at the low devices
resorted to by white men to work the Amerinds for their own
profit. A great deal that is base and mean is now excused on
the ground that this is a commercial age, but I can only remark
that if there is to be no standard for measuring modern
conduct but financial profit, the white man's footsteps are
surely on the wrong trail.
</p>

<p>
The reader in following these pages must remember that
comfort is generally relative, and that what appears hard from
the chimney corner may have been comparative luxury. I
have never slept more comfortably anywhere than under a foot
of snow.
</p>

<p>
I have had much kind assistance and am grateful for it. I
am particularly obliged to Mr. William J. Schieffelin for the
generous and unlimited use of valuable books from his library;
to Mr. E. H. Harriman for transportation favours; also for the
same to Mr. S. K. Hooper; to Mr. F. M. Bishop for the
loan of a volume on Jacob Hamblin not otherwise obtainable;
to Mr. O. D. Wheeler and the Montana Historical
Society for cuts; to Captain E. L. Berthoud, Edgar A. Rider,
and Jack Sumner for manuscript notes; to Mr. L. H. Johnson
for manuscript notes and photographs; to Mr. B. L. Young
for a special drawing of the rock pecking of a buffalo in
southern Utah; to Mr. R. H. Chapman, Mr. J. B. Lippincott,
Mr. J. K. Hillers, Mr. E. E. Howell, Mr. Delancy Gill, for
photographs; and to the United States Bureau of Ethnology
for the use of illustration material. I would also here thank
my publishers for their constant consideration, for presents of
books pertaining to my subject, and for the loan of others; and
Mr. H. C. Rizer, chief clerk of the United States Geological
Survey, for assistance and courtesies extending over a long
series of years. Finally I wish to express my renewed thanks
for many favours to the veteran geographer and explorer,
A. H. Thompson, of the United States Geological Survey, to
whom I have the honour of dedicating this book.

BREAKING THE WILDERNESS

<h2>
CHAPTER I
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
Extent of the Wilderness—The First White Man—The Backbone of the Continent—A
Vanished Sea and a Petrified Ocean—The Biggest Trees—The
Spike of Gold.
</p>

<p>
The natural habitat of man is the wilderness. No matter
how civilised he may become, his heart turns with longing
to the woods, to the sea, and to the mountains. There he is
unconventional; animals are his compeers, the forest his friend,
the free-flowing stream nectar to his lips. Civilised peoples,
after all, are but wanderers driven from the Garden of Eden
by the sword of necessity. Of the virtues they claim, a large
proportion is imperative, the result of conflicting numbers—society's
effort to preserve itself. Men are no better, no
worse, in the wilderness or in civilisation; nor does race or
colour appear exactly to define quality. By noting this at the
outset we may be inclined to be more sympathetic; and therefore
may better understand the superb wilderness which forms
the subject of this work.
</p>

<p>
Nearly two-thirds of the entire present area of the United
States was comprised in it, extending between the north and
south bounds of the Union, from the Mississippi on the one
hand, to the Pacific on the other; a vast region of marvellous
diversity, greater far than several of the Old-World empires
rolled into one. Up to the hour when the Santa Maria flung
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
her parting banners out and under the steady will of the Admiral
moved upon the Western Mystery, no European had
ever beheld the wide horizon of this splendid realm, nor yet
even dreamed of it, for whatever in the way of exploration
prior to Columbus the Northmen may have accomplished on
the Atlantic coast of America, we may be sure not one of
them ever set foot beyond the banks of the Father of Waters.
And so this land, unknown to Europeans, remained unknown
till the year when Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, escaping from
the terrible disasters of the Narvaez Florida expedition, in his
enforced long wanderings, crossed the lower margin, now the
State of Texas, and in 1536, less than four decades after the
Discovery, gave to expectant Europe first news of the "hunchback
cows" and the great interior. That was a day of marvels.
After Mexico and Peru anything! Though we may smile at
the imaginings of those iron-nerved Spaniards, they were not
inconsistent with their time. Now the mighty tract is well
known to us, but our knowledge has come piecemeal through
centuries of endeavour, the last portion of the unknown yielding
only so late as 1869. It is a romantic story. In these
pages the salient features will be traced with special attention
to the doings of the trappers and traders who bore in its conquest
so dominating an influence.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning it will be well to glance at the main facts
of the region, and see what it was that the newcomers were
compelled to encounter and overcome before the land became
theirs. Vast mountain chains there were, turbulent rivers,
deserts and semi-deserts, and forbidding gorges. Almost
through the middle, trending north-westerly and south-easterly,
stretched the great Backbone of the continent, the Shining
Mountains, or, as we now call them, the Rocky Mountains,
with many peaks reaching up beyond the timber-line and into
the realm of perpetual snow, peaks now familiar under the
names of early explorers like Pike, Long, James, Frémont,
etc., and whose meandering crest composed the Continental
Divide, casting the rains on one side into the broad Pacific,
and on the other side into the tides that laved the shores of
Europe. For a considerable portion of the year deep snows
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3' href='#Page_3'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
upon these heights prevented all crossing, except at great
hazard. This mountain range was at the same time the western
limit of the most remarkable and bountiful river valley in
all the world, the basin of the Mississippi, whose other edge
was bounded by the verdant slopes of the Alleghanies, and
which came within a stone's throw of the Niagara cataract
and the Great Lakes.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Four large rivers of immense length took their rise towards
the north on the summits of the Backbone, the greatest three
springing like triplets of a single mother from practically the
same spot in what is now Wyoming. One of these, rushing
toward the north-west over a cataract that rivals Niagara, and
over falls and wild rapids, swept into the Pacific through a
line of dangerous breakers which, notwithstanding the labours
of our best engineers, still remains a barrier to the entrance.
This was the "River of the West," now the Columbia, taking
its name from the ship of Captain Gray, the first to sail into
its mouth. Another river, the real continuation of the Mississippi,
ran its course for some three thousand miles before
joining the parent stream at a point still more than a thousand
miles from the Gulf of Mexico, navigable in high-water
season for boats of moderate draught for about two thousand
miles of its length above the junction. This was the Missouri,
at first the main highway from the east into the wilderness,
leading the trappers and traders to the very threshold of the
great mountains. The third river, the Seedskedee, the Rio
Colorado Grande of the Spaniards, now the Green and Colorado,
started just over the range at the head of the Missouri
and the Columbia, and leaping down the westerly precipices in
bold cataracts, made for the south-west and the gulf now
called California, never heeding the mountain barriers, but for
half its two thousand miles of length cleaving through them,
a series of terrifying chasms, deep and difficult, where its
waters are torn by hundreds of loud rapids, and whose tributary
chasms unite with the mother gorges to interpose almost
insurmountable obstacles in the path of the explorer,—the last
portion of the wilderness to be vanquished and, though vanquished,
yet to this day formidable and defiant. The fourth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
river, less in magnitude and vigour than the others, but nevertheless
fractious, rose some miles southward of their birthplace
on the rugged slopes of spurs of the great range, and sweeping
to the south and south-east entered the Gulf of Mexico. This
was the Rio Grande del Norte, now abbreviated to Rio Grande,
and forming for a long distance the boundary of Mexico. It
was on this river that the first settlements were made in
the wilderness, by Europeans, in what is now New Mexico.

<p>
East of the huge central mountain system there rolled
away from the base of the range to the Mississippi endless
plains resembling a petrified ocean; the prairies, treeless, sublime
in their immensity. For about half the distance from
the mountains to the river, approximately as far as the 100th
meridian, this enormous territory was well-nigh rainless, thus
presenting an additional barrier to investigation from the
eastward. The remaining half was invitingly fertile. Across
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
these wide prairies meandered eastwardly several branches of
the Missouri and the Mississippi, chief among them the Platte,
the Arkansas, and Red River. West of the Backbone lay a
maze of mountains, "parks," deep gorges, now called canyons,
cliffs, plateaus, and valleys, limited on the far western side by
a second mother-range rivalling in height and extent and impenetrability
the central system itself. This was the Sierra
Nevada and its upper continuation, the Cascade Range.
About midway between the two master ranges another, the
Wasatch, extended northerly and southerly, forming the eastern
limit of the dry bed of an ancient sea of which a small
remnant remained concentrated in a salt lake some fifty miles
in length. This vanished sea is now known as Lake Bonneville,
its old bed as the "Great Basin." Its southern rim
breaks down from an altitude of about ten thousand feet in a
series of mighty cliffs, like cyclopean steps, to the canyons of
the Colorado, and near the summit of this rim a river starts
north down into the basin, sweeping along for many miles to
turn suddenly to the westward and end in a lake without
visible outlet, in the middle of a stretch of desert. This is
now the Sevier. West of the salt lake another stream, the
Humboldt, took its rise and, darting boldly toward the Sierra
as if to cut it in twain, meekly collapsed in a small lake at the
foot. Between the Wasatch and the Rocky Mountains lay
the valley of the Colorado, already mentioned, a marvellous
labyrinth of canyons and cliffs, of dead volcanoes, lava beds,
plateaus, and mountain peaks of rare beauty.

</div>

<p>
Some of the stream branches took their rise in a series of
deep valleys called "parks," lying close within the main range
and known to-day as North, Middle, and South parks, with
still another below South Park, called San Luis Park, in which
heads the Rio Grande. Thus the wide area intervening between
the two chief mountain systems, the Rocky and the
Sierra, was one of extraordinary topographical diversity, presenting
innumerable minor mountain ranges (most of them,
like the mother chains, trending northerly and southerly),
lines of high cliffs of great length, extensive plateaus, and
wonderful gorges like mountain ranges hollowed out and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
turned upside down below the surface of the earth, gorges so
long and so deep as to absolutely and completely separate the
areas lying on their opposite sides. East of the Rocky Mountains
was the vast prairie land mentioned, while west of the
Sierra lay the sunland now known as California, with the
moister region of Oregon immediately above it cut in twain
by the Columbia rushing triumphantly to the sea. Here too
was still another lesser mountain chain, the Coast Range.
</p>

<p>
On the headwaters of the Yellowstone branch of the Missouri
was a district of hot springs and geysers, famous now the
world round. Here also were the great falls of the Yellowstone
and its celebrated canyon, so wonderful in the variety and
brilliancy of its colouring, now held, by the wisdom of Congress,
for a National Park. Farther south, like a beacon for the
Christian pilgrim, there shone aloft, formed in ice and snow,
on the topmost slopes of a high peak, the semblance of a perfect
cross. The Arkansas, in freeing itself from the mountains,
carved through them a long gorge, deep and narrow, of splendid
picturesqueness, which later made a highway for the locomotive.
Besides the Great Salt Lake there were broad salt
lagoons farther south in what is now New Mexico, and in
California likewise salt spread itself by tons and tons over the
surface of the ground. In Southern Utah were the superb
Temples of the Rio Virgen. In the Sierra Nevada was the
now celebrated Yosemite, one of the grandest valleys on the
globe; and there too stood the largest known trees, patriarchs
from a former age, three hundred feet in height, with trunks
of enormous circumference—the <i>Sequoia</i>. Here also were the
redwood forests, scarcely less noble than the <i>Sequoia</i>. The
vegetation was as varied as the topography. On the prairies
of what is now Kansas flourished the sensitive plant, covering
the ground with its lovely rose-coloured, rose-scented blossoms,
round as a puff-ball, the delicate stems withering at the touch
of a human hand, to lift themselves again when the intruder
had withdrawn. Farther west the antithesis of this exquisitely
sensitive growth, the cactus, spread its defiant lances everywhere,
and there it was the human hand and not the plant
which withered at the touch. And the cactus was no less
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
beautiful than the sensitive "rose"; indeed, more beautiful,
for nothing could exceed the gorgeousness of its blossoms of
various shades of red, or yellow, or white as they stood resplendent
under the glowing sun against the soft colour of the
earth.

<p>
At the north, and on the higher lands of the south, grew
the pine trees in magnificent forests, with the beautiful spruce
and cedar, the latter attaining its noblest proportions in the
north-west. Towards the south, on the lower lands, grew the
juniper and the piñon, the latter bearing a delicious, edible
nut, a boon to the native. In the south, too, were the mesquite
with its sweet bean, and the splendid yuccas, some of them
tree-like and twenty or thirty feet high, the pitahaya, and
many other plants strange to European eyes. These and the
cacti require a dry climate and a hot one, and the southern
portion of the wilderness was particularly dry and hot. The
extreme south-western part was the driest and the hottest, and
there stretches of real desert interposed further obstacles to
exploration and to settlement. On the other hand, the climate
of the extreme north-west was the reverse. There mist and
rain, nearly unknown in the lower basin of the Colorado, were
almost constant. But the characteristic of the major part of
the wilderness was excessive dryness, prohibiting agriculture
without irrigation. The high peaks, receiving snow and rain
in plenty, dealt out the moisture generously through creeks
and rivers upon the parching plains roundabout.

<p>
Thus there were wide deserts as well as regions of humidity;
an immense range in climate with a corresponding range in
life zones, till the biologist discovered in this area specimens
ranging from the boreal to the tropical. The animals were of
all kinds found on the North American continent. There
were scorpions, tarantulas, snakes (many varieties of rattlesnakes)
in the south; there and elsewhere beaver, bison,
panthers, bears, wolves, deer, elk, mountain sheep, and small
game of various kinds, all adjusted to altitude or latitude.
Bears were particularly numerous. The bison (buffalo) roamed
the east in countless numbers, crossing the Rocky Mountains
and pushing westward to the Pecos, to Green River, and to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
the Columbia. As a wild animal the bison now is extinct,
and it is difficult to imagine the enormous herds that so short
a time ago at will traversed the face of the wilderness. The
beaver existed in vast numbers also, and this fact was the first
incentive to exploration of the immense tract by Americans.
Deer and antelope grazed everywhere and scarcely a day could
pass without the traveller sighting some of these animals. All
furnished subsistence to the man who was there, the Amerind.
Because this person was not a European he has often been
regarded as hardly worth consideration, but he was a good
specimen of mankind in the hunter state. Physically and
mentally he had few superiors. He knew the country as well
as we know it to-day. He knew every pass in the mountains,
every buffalo trail. Each tribe knew its own land limits, as
well as those of its neighbours, and each defended its home
with unsurpassed daring and bravery.
</p>

<p>
This was the wilderness when the hordes of Europe descended
upon it and claimed it for their own. Well did they
fight their way into it, and equally well did the native oppose
the invasion and fight to preserve his ancestral home in all
its freedom and pristine glory. But the Europeans were
stronger and wrested it from him, from the animals, and from
Nature; yet it was never fully theirs till the sledge drove
home that last spike of gold that pinned the East and the
West together and tacked the skirts of Europe to those of
Cathay.

<h2>
CHAPTER II
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
The Intelligent Beaver, Chief of the Rodents—A Four-Footed Engineer—A
Builder of Houses, Artificial Canals, Dams, Ponds, and Lakes—Beaver
Meadows—A Masterful Woodchopper—A Tail for the Epicure—Muskbogs—The
Fatal Trap.
</p>

<p>
Several factors combined to break the wilderness to the
uses of the Americans into whose possession it eventually
fell. One of these, and it was one of the most important in
its effect on primary exploration, was the presence there in
vast numbers of a comparatively small and singularly intelligent
animal called the beaver, belonging to the order <i>Rodentia</i>.
While not of great size it was, nevertheless, with one exception,
the largest of its kind, weighing thirty or forty pounds and being
about three and one-half feet long. In colour it was chestnut
brown and was endowed with a rich, thick fur, one-half to three-quarters
inch long, with coarse hair scattered through it about
one inch longer. It so happened that this particular quality
of fur was in great commercial demand in Europe for the making
of hats. For some time it had constituted an article of
profitable export from the eastern part of the continent, as the
similar animal in Europe had been exterminated. Finally the
supply from America also diminished as the trappers pursued
their merciless task. Then followed the discovery that the
great wild region west of the Mississippi contained beaver in
immense numbers, and beaver trapping immediately became
the principal quest of many bold natures eager to stake their
lives in a tilt with Fortune, just as others later played a different
game with the golden gravels of California.

<p>
In their search for the most lucrative beaver grounds they
crossed the boundless prairies, and stimulated by the prospect
of riches and the excitement of new scenes they sought the
innermost recesses of the mountain wilderness, slaying what
opposed their way, taking beaver by thousands and tens of
thousands, and sending pack upon pack by way of St. Louis
to the waiting markets
of the Old World. The
early returns may be estimated
from the success
of one enterprising man
who, having employed a
band of expert trappers,
came out of the far regions
on one occasion
with nearly two hundred
packs, each worth in St.
Louis about one thousand
dollars. In one
period of two and one-half
years, over six hundred
thousand beaver
skins were sent out by
one of the great companies
that were organised
systematically to prosecute
the fur business in
North America.<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> Thus
it was that the beaver
became responsible for
the first opening of the
great western Unknown,
and in order fully to understand the interesting story of human
endeavour, it is necessary to glance at the characteristics of
this remarkable creature, which unwittingly performed such a
prominent part in affairs so momentous to the American
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
Republic and to the world, and which in consequence has become
almost extinct. By it was the trapper and trader led
from the Mississippi to the Western Ocean, and from the Gila
River to and beyond the bounds of Canada.
</p>

<p>
With so great regularity was the daily life of the beaver
ordered that the hunters in their admiration ascribed to it
mental qualities which probably it did not actually possess,
yet it certainly executed well defined works with skill and precision,
and performed many acts which might easily have been
the result of mental processes.<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> A house builder and an
engineer, it constructed for its occupation comfortable lodges,
it excavated canals for its convenience, and formed ponds and
lakes of considerable extent by means of dams made of trees,
sticks, mud, and stones. Moreover, the trees were felled by
its own efforts, and cut up into pieces suitable for the object
desired. The mud and stones were then combined with these
pieces with a dexterity that was astonishing and that will
always command for this amphibious, burrowing creature of
the genus <i>Castor</i> a high rank in the animal world. Its paws
were supplied with long, strong claws, the hind ones having an
extra claw peculiar to the beaver. The front pair were small
and were used deftly like human hands; and the animal could
walk erect on its hind feet carrying small stones and earth,
pressed against the throat, for house or dam building; it could
drag poles and sticks in the same manner. When necessary to
move larger stones they pushed them along, sometimes using
the tail also, and stones of five or six pounds' weight were
moved in this way. All their works were of the same general
character, and in each class they did not vary their methods,
which were largely dictated by surrounding conditions. Being
amphibious, they naturally lived by and in water. Their food
being tender bark and small twigs of trees, they were forced to
gnaw down woody growths to exist, and as these growths near
streams usually incline toward the water they naturally fell into
or across the channel. Accumulations of driftwood and of the
discarded food sticks started dams, and the animal aided the
natural construction by adding mud and more sticks. Thus,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
perhaps, its habits were begun in the remote past by what is
called instinct rather than any reasoning quality, yet there remains
always the problem as to where instinct stops and reason
begins. At any rate there appears to have been no very deep
intellectuality about the beaver, notwithstanding its dexterity
and ingenuity. It was moulded
by the laws of its life exactly as
the spider is when it spins a web;
yet in the case of the beaver
there was a complexity of action
that seems extraordinary, although
the action apparently was always
that which beaver after beaver
had employed for an immense
period. Where a stream was large
and deep or swift, the beaver
could not build a dam, nor was it
necessary, as it could and did burrow
into the banks, excavating
a chamber above the water-level,
and the primary object of the
dam was to supply deep water to
cover the lodge entrance. Where
waters were continually swift or
turbulent and uncontrollable, and
especially where they were not
bordered by an abundance of cottonwoods,
willows, yellow birch,
or other favourite food wood, the
beaver was absent. For these
reasons they were never found in
deep canyons. The trappers, as
soon as by some bitter experience they discovered this, sought
them no further in such localities, hence while these men
traversed almost every other foot of the great wilderness, the
huge canyons, particularly those of the Colorado River series,
were avoided. They continued, therefore, <i><span lang="la">terra incognita</span></i> long
after the remainder of the region was broken; till, in fact,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
the remarkable boat journey of Major Powell in 1869 fathomed
their mysteries. Thus the habits of the beaver controlled
widely separated events.

Where brooks or creeks were small with the proper wood
growths beaver were abundant, as well as in natural lakes and
on all the quieter reaches of the large rivers. Across small
streams trees were felled, and with the aid of sticks, mud, and
stones the beaver laid up a dam to back up the water and
form a basin wherein could be built their lodges with entrances
below the surface. On mountain streams these dams one
above another often transformed them for long distances into
a series of pools and ponds where great numbers of beaver
made their homes. In such places a trapper would reap a
speedy reward, more particularly as there was no thought of
sparing any of the creatures for the future. Often fifty or
sixty beaver would be taken in a single night.
</p>

<p>
According to Morgan, dams were of two kinds, the "stick"
and the "solid bank." The former was made by a combination
of sticks and poles on the lower side, while the upper was
built of sticks and earth. The sticks were laid in the direction
of the current with the butts up-stream, and not across. This
was probably due to the animal's inability to lay the stick in
any other way, the current itself determining the beaver's conduct,
though it is possible that experience had taught that this
was the best method, for by such arrangement the water was
not wholly obstructed and, percolating through the interstices,
was less likely to break away the structure. The other form
of dam, the solid bank, was merely a modification of the stick
dam adapted to a deeper channel. Large quantities of earth
and stones were added to this to enable it to withstand the
greater force of water, and this seems to indicate some degree
of contemplation on the part of the builder; yet the result was
natural, as the animal, having placed earth on one form of dam,
would go on placing earth on the same form in deeper water as
a matter of instinct. But there was one touch in the construction
of the solid-bank dam which more than any other
appeared to be the result of thought. This was an opening
left in the top of the dam, several inches lower than the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
remainder, and three or four feet long, as a spillway for surplus
water. In the stick dam no spillway was provided because the
surplus was allowed to flow through the interstices, so that the
construction of this feature in the larger, more compact dams
seems to have been an example of pure invention to guard
against possible disaster.

All dams were begun at the surface and no sticks or stakes
were driven down in beginning to hold in place the sticks that
were to compose the bulk of the structure. Earth and stones,
the latter of as much as six pounds each in weight, were brought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
to the spot and piled on the sticks. Trappers asserted that
they would load each other's backs with earth and stones to be
carried to the site, but this statement is not sufficiently authenticated
to receive much confidence. In form all dams
were curved, up stream in small dams and down in the larger.
This was doubtless due to the current, which in small streams,
obstructed easily in the centre, would become stronger on the
sides and push the sticks down, while the reverse would be the
case in large streams. Ordinarily the dams would support a
man's weight. They seemed like masses of driftwood under
the foot. The older they were, the more compact. Within
the ponds, formed by these remarkable dams, sometimes covering
more than fifty acres, one or many lodges were built to
furnish shelter and protection to the beaver family. These
houses were dome-shaped structures composed of sticks and
mud, the dome rising above the water-level between four or
five feet and extending along it about sixteen feet. The top
of the lodge was left rather loose, but below it was compact
with earth. This gave the interior sufficient ventilation. The
floor, which was about two inches above the water-line, was
hard and clean with, in summer time, fresh cut grass around
the sides. Being so near the level the inmates could tell, by
the lowering of the surface, whether the dam had a break in it,
in which case they would sally forth to make repairs. Trappers
took advantage of this trait, breaking the dam and setting
traps in the break. The interiors were about two yards in
diameter and twelve to sixteen inches in height, the roof above
being about three feet in thickness, while the sides were four or
five. There were several kinds of entrances, ten to fifteen feet
long, but one was always straight with an inclined floor, to permit
food sticks to be taken into the house and out again when
the bark on them had been consumed. Then the sticks were
used in construction work. Other entrances were more abrupt
and full of curves. The winter pile of food sticks was sunk
alongside the house where it was easily accessible under the
ice. No animal could successfully attack one of these lodges,
so that the family within it was perfectly safe, but men with
axes could force an entrance from above.

In low ground the dams backing the water around trees
killed them and in course of time they would disappear, leaving
in their place an open, boggy space covered with a growth
of rank vegetation. These were called by the hunters "beaver
meadows." The "beaver canals" were cut through marshy
places and were sometimes prominent features of the local
landscape, extending four or five hundred feet in length, and
having a breadth of three feet, with a depth of fifteen to thirty
inches.
</p>

<p>
When in the water the beaver was far more graceful and
active than when on land, swimming powerfully by means of
its large, strong, webbed hind feet, aided, when speed was desired,
by the broad, flat tail used like the blade of a sculling oar,
which, indeed, it much resembled, being ten inches long by
five wide, and smooth, hard, and scaly, and entirely devoid of
the soft fur which covered the body. Besides this use in
swimming, the tail served as a prop when the animal desired to
sit up on land, and also as a sort of trowel for beating down
the mud-mortar used in dam building. At night it was also
struck sharply on the surface of the water as a signal of alarm,
giving a report which sounded, in the stillness, like a pistol
shot and could be heard for a long distance. In regions frequented
by man, or where in any way likely to be disturbed,
the beaver was nocturnal and did most of its work during the
dark hours, but where unmolested it spent much time out in
the broad daylight. I saw large numbers swimming about in
daytime when on Green River in 1871, in Wonsits Valley,
where white men had rarely passed, and they gave no indication
of special alarm at sight of us. Perhaps they regarded
our boats as nothing more than drifting logs, just as the seal
of Alaska is deceived by the trick the natives there have of
covering themselves and their canoes with white cloth to resemble
floating ice. At one point where we were in camp a
whole day within a few hundred yards of a colony actively
engaged in their various labours in the sunlight of the river
bank, they apparently did not notice our presence, and even a
rifle ball sent among them did not seem to derange their
equanimity. In this locality the banks were full of burrows,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
and as we passed along in our boats we could see the beaver
swimming around in every direction. We shot at several, but
as they immediately sink to the bottom when killed, the gun is
not successful in taking them, except in very shallow streams.
We would have failed altogether albeit we made no special
effort, had not one of the boats been able to head off a large
fellow that was wounded, just as he arrived at the opening of
his burrow, which happened, at that stage of river, to be a
little above the water-level. A moment more and the animal
would have been safe from us, but though the bottom was invisible
on account of the turbidity of the river, one of our men
quickly took the plunge and grasped the beaver from behind
firmly around the middle at the moment when its head was
almost against the steep high bank. The depth was no more
than about three feet, and though the beating of the heavy tail,
and the fierce struggles, made it anything but easy, the beaver
was thrown into the boat, where a blow from an oar finished
him. The captor, drenched and covered with mud, climbed
triumphantly on board. Some of the meat was cooked and
suggested to me beef in flavour, though it was rather tough
and unappetising. The tail makes a soup which is the delight
of the epicure, or was, when beaver tails were procurable, but
somehow that which our cook concocted did not strike our
palates favourably and we abandoned it for the regulation
bacon and beans. Beaver meat was often the only food the
trapper and frontiersman could obtain, and they considered it
quite a good article of diet. The one we tested was doubtless
too old a specimen, and we had no opportunity to secure another,
for we passed on into the great Canyon of Desolation
and saw beaver no more.

<p>
When at work cutting down a tree they stood on their hind
legs, supported also by the tail, two working at one time on
the same tree. They began eight or ten inches above the base
and cut round and round, making each successive cut wider
and deeper, the chips thrown off being some three inches in
length by one and one-half wide, and one-quarter thick, each
showing the sharp, clean strokes of the teeth, and resembling
chips made with an axe. As the trees selected were always
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
soft wood, they were easily gnawed while green. A tree of
considerable size would be readily felled in two or three nights.
Often they worked in pairs at a number of trees at one time,
and nineteen falls, says Morgan, have been counted in a single
night between the hours of seven and twelve. Cottonwoods
twenty-four inches in diameter were brought down, though
the more ordinary size was fourteen to sixteen inches. Father
de Smet saw a stump that was thirty inches in diameter.
</p>

<p>
At first glance a beaver stump looks almost as if it might
have been cut by an axe in the hands of an inexperienced
chopper. Pine trees were sometimes cut down, but the boughs
were not used for food. Food branches were cut up into
lengths of one to two feet, for convenience in handling and
storing. Sometimes trees that fell with their tops in the deep
water were allowed to remain this way till winter, when the
branches were cut off under the ice. As the beaver was able
to stay below the surface comfortably from five to ten minutes,
he could accomplish his work there with ease. Both sexes
possessed in two glands of the groin a musky secretion called
<i><span lang="la">castoreum</span></i>, which was used in medicine and also as a bait for
the animal itself. When at play they would void some of this
musk upon the ground, and their favourite playgrounds were
consequently called by the trappers "muskbogs."
</p>

<p>
Hunters sometimes found trees standing near a stream that
were partly cut, and they observed that in these cases the trees
would not have fallen into the water, from which they inferred
that cutting these trees had been started by young, inexperienced
beavers who had finally been stopped in the useless
labour by their wise elders. Bradbury, the English naturalist
who was in the West with Wilson Price Hunt in 1809, thought
he found some substantiation of this theory in trees he carefully
examined—at least, none of these trees would have fallen
across the neighbouring streams. Inasmuch as these animals,
however, were in constant need of food branches, there would
seem to have been no good reason for preventing the young
beaver from completing the cutting of any tree no matter
where it might drop. That the beaver had gone into the study
of forestry and was endeavouring to preserve the woods is not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
likely, nor is it probable that the time of the youthful beaver
was valuable. If all stumps in a given locality had been examined,
doubtless it would have been found that a considerable
number of trees had not fallen across the stream or even in its
direction. A more probable explanation of these half-cut trees
would be that from time to time some of those engaged in
gnawing were interrupted during the operation, perhaps killed,
and prevented from resuming, and that the rest, having their
attention engaged on other trees or their branches, were not
impelled to take up the work. The tree being girdled soon
died. Then the fibre of the wood growing dry and hard, the
tree would be avoided, because there were always plenty of
fresh, juicy ones to cut. The tops of the old dead trees would
also be of no use for food. So while the young may have been
regularly educated as the trappers believed, this particular
illustration of wise guidance does not appear convincing. It
was also believed that an old beaver which had once escaped
a trap could not again easily be caught, for the reason that
thereafter it carried a stick in its mouth with which to test
suspicious places and spring any trap that might be in its way.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless the trap was fatal to these industrious and ingenious
animals, and by the year 1835 they had been reduced
in numbers to such a degree that they were no longer the chief
lure and gain of the fur hunter. The native, before the opening
of the European market, not having much use for such
small skins and preferring the meat of other game for food, the
beaver for ages had been practically unmolested. But the
footsteps of the American trapper sounded his death knell.
At the same time they sounded the same knell for every living
thing in the whole vast wilderness, and now, a century after,
not only is it next to impossible to find a beaver colony in
that immense array of mountain and plain, but all wild animals
have become more or less of a curiosity, only preserved from
absolute extermination by the most rigorous game laws. Killing
for fun is even more destructive than killing for profit.
</p>

<p>
The principal contrivance employed in taking beaver was
the common steel trap, a couple of jaws so arranged that they
could be spread and set on a trigger which was connected with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
a treadle in the centre. When the animal stepped on this
treadle, the powerful jaws were freed and were brought fiercely
together by a spring, clamping the leg of the victim securely.
The trap being fastened to a strong chain and this to a stake,
the captive could not escape, unless it gnawed its own leg off,
and it is said
beaver sometimes
did this.
The trap was set
in the line of a
runway or trail
or near the entrance
to a burrow,
with a stick
leaning over it
on the extremity of which was the bait, a small quantity of
castoreum, of gum camphor, oil of juniper, cinnamon, or
cloves. The last two were dissolved in alcohol and made into
a paste. In reaching for the bait, the beaver stepped on the
treadle of the trap. The hunter made his rounds regularly
to gather in the pelts of the captives, resetting the traps for
another catch if the locality was promising, or, if the contrary,
taking them up and pushing on in search of better ground.
In the very beginning those first in a rich spot of course
reaped the best harvest, and it was the desire to obtain large
and quick returns that induced trappers constantly to enter
farther and farther into the unfathomed places. The move
was not always a wise one. Frequently they left comparatively
good ground and came to that which was lean, or perhaps
entirely devoid of the animal sought.

<p>
Sometimes the trap was set so that the ring attached to the
end of the chain, as soon as the captive dived, would slide
down to the small end of a pole planted in the water, preventing
the ascent of the beaver and consequently drowning
it. At the lodge, rows of strong stakes were driven in such a
way as to form alleys leading to the entrances through which
the members of the family would have to pass to reach the
house, the trap being cunningly concealed on the bottom. In
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
winter, as it was easy to discover the lodges because the snow
was melted away from above by the rising warm air, the tops
were chopped in, and the beaver taken in this way. The
store of winter food sticks being placed in a pile beside the
lodge, the trappers often staked around it to compel the beaver
to enter for food at points where traps were set. When it was
driven to its bank burrows, the entrances were closed and then
the occupants were dug out from above. The setting of steel
traps, however, and visiting them at regular intervals was the
easiest and most profitable method, for one man could take
care of fifty traps or more, without great difficulty. One peculiarity
of the animal was of great service to its pursuers,—it
never stepped backwards. Altogether the poor creature was
an easy prey to the keen hunter, and the capture of it amounted
to wholesale slaughter.
</p>

<p>
In disposition the beaver was gentle and shy. When caught
very young, they became perfectly tame and contented. Native
women sometimes nursed young captives as they would a child,
till, in a few weeks, they were old enough to eat bark, when
they would wean themselves. Their cry resembled that of a
human infant, and their affectionate natures made them attractive
and satisfactory pets. Full growth was attained at two
and one-half years, and they died of old age at about fifteen.
A beaver family consisted of the two parents and the several
offspring under two years of age, all living in one lodge or
burrow. Occasionally a male refused to pair, and then after
the second season he was driven from the colony and became
an outcast. Their interesting social organisation and general
sagacity placed them in the very top rank among animals.
</p>

<p>
This small creature, then, that offered its life as a bait to
entice the white man into the depths of the wilderness, was one
of the most remarkable on the continent, and its likeness, as the
emblem of the American Republic, would be far more appropriate
than the carrion eagle, which has little to commend it,
as compared with the beaver, the model of gentleness, industry,
ingenuity, and painstaking skill, and which formed a stepping-stone
to the power and greatness of the Union of States now
spreading from ocean to ocean.

Another denizen of the wilderness that performed an
important part in its preparation for occupation by the
white race was the buffalo or <i><span lang="la">Bison Americanus</span></i>, a monarch of
the plains, huge and fierce in appearance; a monarch with the
mien of a lion and the resistance of a sheep; an animal quite
the opposite of the interesting beaver in almost every particular
but numbers. In this respect, however, it vied with its smaller
associate, roaming by millions and millions up and down across
the limitless prairie-ocean, apparently as inexhaustible as the
vagrant breezes blowing one day here and one day there. But
the breezes still waft above the billowy surface, while the bison
has vanished like a dream. The farm, the ranch, the town,
and the railway now claim his vast grazing grounds. Were it
not for a few specimens preserved in private herds and zoölogical
gardens, this strange creature would be as unfamiliar to
us in the life as are the <i>Dinosaurs</i> of the Jurassic plains.

They were the "hunchback cows" which Alvar Nuñez Cabeza
de Vaca first accurately described to the European world,
although it is said that Montezuma had one captive in his collection
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
of animals at the time Cortez pillaged the Aztec capital.
They were later called "cattle or cows of <i>Cibola</i>" (and <i>Sibolo</i>)<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>
by the Spaniards, perhaps because the inhabitants of the first
group of native villages of New Mexico encountered by Coronado
were supplied with buffalo robes and were in the habit of
going to hunt the animals on the plains of the river Pecos,
where at that time they were abundant. The name passed
into common use and to-day, although there is the correct
word <i><span lang="es_ES">Bisónte</span></i>, the American bison is generally known in Spanish
as <i><span lang="es_ES">Cibolo</span></i>. In his celebrated traverse of the Texas and Kansas
prairies in 1540 Coronado saw immense herds that roamed
there. The buffalo range was great, especially in a north and
south direction, its southernmost limit having been in north-eastern
Mexico a little below the lower end of Texas, while its
northernmost was the upper shores of Great Slave Lake. It
seems, however, that it did not cover this range in latitude at
one time, so that in Coronado's day the northern limit was
doubtless considerably below Great Slave Lake. The buffalo
was not migratory in the sense that herds from the extreme
north traversed the entire range and occupied a place on the
southern edge, but it was migratory as a whole, swinging back
and forth from north to south and south to north like a huge
pendulum, the various sub-herds always retaining practically
the same relative position to the complete mass. It appears
also that in this annual oscillation with the seasons it gradually
retired from the extreme southern limit and encroached beyond
its northern limit, till the position at the north mentioned was
arrived at. This is indicated by the statement of an Amerind
of the Athabasca country, who in explaining his age to Mackenzie,
said that "he remembered the opposite hills and plains
now interspersed with groves of poplars, when they were
covered with moss, and without any animal inhabitant but the
reindeer. By degrees, he said, the face of the country changed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
to its present appearance, when the elk came from the east and
was followed by the buffalo; the reindeer then retired to
... a considerable distance."<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> It is therefore quite
probable that, had not the European arrived to interfere, the
buffalo eventually would have gone farther north and would
have spread over Alaska. It was perfectly at home in the cold
northland so long as the summers permitted grass and herbage
to mature. The Saskatchewan country was full of them all
winter, though they were forced to paw away the snow to
reach the grass. The range east and west was also extensive,
though this was not the direction of its annual movement. Its
eastern limit was the extent of the Mississippi valley north of
the Tennessee; and possibly as far as Lake Champlain. While
seemingly not as numerous in this eastern part of its range as
farther west, yet there were large numbers, and the hunters
of the early days of European settlement often killed them.
Albert Gallatin states that while in western Virginia in 1784
he subsisted chiefly on buffalo meat. The city of Buffalo
takes its name from this animal, which formerly fed on its site.
That they were abundant in this eastern region long before
Gallatin's time is established by the large quantities of their
bones found around the salt licks of the Ohio valley. At Big
Bone Lick, Kentucky, these accumulations are so great as to
indicate, beyond question, a very remote date for the beginning
of the range of the buffalo in this region. Beneath them
the bones of the mastodon are discovered.<a name='FA_6' id='FA_6' href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>
</p>

<p>
It is strange that no bison remains have thus far been found
in the ancient mounds of the Mississippi valley; nor are there
any images of them on Moundbuilder pipes. It is also strange
that, despite the abundance of buffalo throughout the greater
part of the West, pictures of it made by the natives should be
so rare. The Sioux lived with and on the bison, yet they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
seldom drew it, while their robes are covered with drawings of
horses and other animals.
</p>

<p>
On the west the limit of the range, at least north of about
latitude 41°, up to the end of the first decade of the nineteenth
century seems to have been the Rocky Mountains. Lewis and
Clark, on their great journey of 1804-06, make no mention of
the buffalo on the Pacific side of the mountains, hence it is
probable that few had crossed there at that time. This
would imply that it was the advance of civilisation which
impelled the buffalo in numbers finally to seek passes over
the Backbone and spread across the upper valley of Green
River, of Bear River, and of the Columbia. The possibility
always remains that there may have been other causes at
work, perhaps climatic, to induce or assist this movement,
and it is also possible that the animal may have crossed
earlier, and have temporarily refrained from migrating in
that direction, perchance on account of extra deep snow or
some such natural interference, although the usual snow did
not prevent their crossing in dead of winter. Escalante's
party in 1776 found abundant signs of buffalo on White
River, near the Green, and killed one there. They named a
canyon Arroyo del Cibolo because of the many buffalo trails
in it.
</p>

<p>
But the modern Pai Utes apparently had no knowledge of
this animal, so that if it ever was found in any numbers in
southern Utah, the period of occupation must have been remote.
Dr. Coues believed that it ranged at one time in Arizona,
though he could not recall the ground for this belief,
simply remembering that it appeared to him sufficient at the
time. The only indication that I know of, of the former
presence of the buffalo in southern Utah is a rock picture
found on the walls of Kanab Canyon (see <a href="#Page_37">page 37</a>), some
eight miles north of latitude 37° and about two west of longitude
112° 30´. This drawing would suggest that some natives
captured a buffalo not far from the spot, though it might have
been the record of a hunt at some other point. Buffalo would
not have been likely to cross the vast depths of the Grand
Canyon to the southward, hence they could have arrived at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
this place easily only by way of the Sevier River, the Escalante
Desert, or by turning the western end of the Grand Canyon.
At Gunnison on Sevier River a buffalo skull was found in a
canyon ten feet below the surface. It is more probable that
they would come from the north, yet if they did not cross the
mountains there till 1810, a new difficulty is met with, for the
present Pai Utes seem not to have made any rock pictures.
These were done by the pottery-making, house-building Amerinds,
who, as far as can be determined, had vanished from
the region long before 1810.

I do not remember any reference to buffalo on Espejo's
trip to Zuñi and west in 1583, nor on the journey Juan de Oñate
made across Arizona and back in 1604-05; it is likely that if
this animal ranged there it was before the time of Coronado.
The south-western limit at that period appears to have been
the first mountain range west of the Rio Pecos. North of
latitude 57° they never crossed the Rocky Mountains. In
1820, according to Long, they had not yet entirely crossed in
the central portion, that is to Green River and the Columbia,
yet in 1824 they were ranging the Green, Columbia, and Bear
River valleys in vast numbers. Up to 1823 they existed in
great herds in the new State of Missouri, and their crossing to
the Pacific slope thus appears about coincident with their retiring
from this eastern ground. In their western range they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
extended as far as the Blue Mountains of Oregon, and even to
the foot of the Sierra Nevada in the region farther south.
Fossil remains have been found, according to Coues, within
the limits of its range, east of the Rocky Mountains. There
were two kinds of buffalo in the opinion of the frontiersmen,
the wood buffalo and the prairie type. Apparently there was
not sufficient differentiation in these to warrant the separation.
They were practically the same, the variation being merely one
of habitat, and individual change, like the occasional development
of an extra rib. The buffalo inhabiting the woods
usually grew to a larger size than that of the plains, but this
was probably the result of a less active life and more abundant
food. All buffalo at maturity were large animals, the male
weighing 1000 to 1500 pounds or more, and the female from
800 to 1200. In size the adult male measured about 9 feet
from muzzle to root of tail, and 13 feet 6 inches to end of tail
including the hairs, which were about 15 inches long. In
similar measurement the adult female was about 6 feet 6 inches
to root of tail and 9 feet to the extreme end, the hairs being
about 10 inches long. The male at the highest part was 5½ to
6 feet and the female about 5 feet; at the hips both sexes were
around 4½ feet. The horns of the male were short and very
thick at the base, with a quick taper to a sharp point. Those
of the female were smaller at the base, but about the same in
length and curve as those of the male. In winter the colour
of the woolly hair was a blackish brown, but it became
lighter in summer and so varied somewhat with season and
locality. The hair was moulted in early spring except that on
the shoulders, which with age became tawny—a yellowish
brown.

The earliest published drawing of the American bison is
supposed to be that which appeared in 1558 in Thevet's book,<a name='FA_7' id='FA_7' href='#FN_7' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a>
sixteen years after the return to Mexico of Coronado, but it
would seem that some illustration of an animal that was considered
so remarkable must have been printed before that.
Since then it has been drawn and painted unnumbered times.
It figured largely, as a matter of course, in Catlin's celebrated

But it was not as material for picture making that the bison
became of greatest value, it was as a meat supply to the trapper,
the trader, and the traveller generally upon the bosom of
that wide expanse of rolling prairie that so resembled the great
salt ocean itself. As Butler<a name='FA_9' id='FA_9' href='#FN_9' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> describes it,
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"the unending vision of sky and grass, the dim, distant, and ever
shifting horizon; the ridges that seem to be rolled upon one another
in motionless torpor; the effect of sunrise and sunset, of night narrowing
the vision to nothing, and morning only expanding it to a
shapeless blank, ... and above all the sense of lonely, unending
distance which comes to the <i><span lang="fr_FR">Voyageur</span></i> when day after day has
gone by, night has closed, and morning dawned upon his onward
progress under the same ever-moving horizon of grass and sky."

No wonder the moment buffalo were first sighted by the
anxious caravan, a joyful cry went up, equivalent, as Irving
says, to the cry of, "A sail, a sail!" at sea. All was commotion
on the instant, and everybody prepared for the hunt. Thenceforward,
as long as buffalo were near, hunger held no terrors on
that boundless plain that now our limited express so contemptuously
spurns beneath its throbbing steel, as the ennuied
lady sits wearisome at the window gazing with disdain on those
blood-bathed reaches of country, so full of thrilling story and
history, a bill of fare in her hand that would have driven the
old voyageur to distraction.

Yet buffalo meat could not have been less delicious to the
appetite of the plains traveller. It not only furnished food for
the moment, but dried, or dried and pounded and mixed with
the rendered tallow, sometimes including berries, it made <i>pemmican</i>,<a name='FA_10' id='FA_10' href='#FN_10' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a>
which could be kept a long time, and which formed the
basis of the supplies for long expeditions and for winter consumption.
The meat from old bulls was often tough, but that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
from a fat cow was always delicious, and the marrow!—well,
that was a dish fit to set before a king. The Hon. Grantley
F. Berkley<a name='FA_11' id='FA_11' href='#FN_11' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a> of England was not exactly a king, unless we
elevate him as far above the Americans as he thought himself
to be, but he appreciated marrow in 1859 when he honoured
the great plains by his presence.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"No man [he exclaims] can guess what marrow amounts to until
he has been to the Far West.... The bone was brought to
table in its full length, and they had some way of hitting it with an
axe which opened one side only, like the lid of a box. The bone
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
then, when this lid was removed, exposed in its entire length a
regular white roll of unbroken marrow, beautifully done. When
hot, as the lid had kept it, and put on thin toast, it was perfection."
</p>
</div>

<p class="post">
Another part that was particularly delicious was the hump or
rather the hump-ribs; and so too was the tongue. Still another
tidbit was the meat along either side of the loin, so that
altogether living was high on the rolling prairie as long as
buffalo held out. Frequently the traveller became so pampered
by these luxuries that he spurned all but the daintiest
parts and thought nothing of killing a cow simply for the marrow
or for the tongue.
</p>

<p>
The poor beast deserved better treatment than it got; indeed,
the only treatment was a dose of lead on sight, even
when no meat was needed. The Amerinds often killed the
bison recklessly before the arrival of the European, yet the
herds would have resisted all such inroads. But when the white
man came he quickly gave the native points in the game of
useless destruction. The buffalo range immediately was transformed
into a vast slaughter-house, and the carcasses were left
to rot and dry under the western sun. And the more civilised
the hunter—that is, the more unaccustomed to the frontier—the
greater the waste of bison life at his hands. <i>More than sixteen
thousand</i> were shot for sport alone, on the plains of Kansas
and Colorado, in 1871. The sportsmen killed all sizes and
ages, pell-mell, just to kill and to ride away at headlong
speed like escaped madmen, never stopping a moment even
for the tongues. Everywhere the carcasses of wantonly slain
buffalo in disgusting masses of putrefaction were lying over
hill and dale.<a name='FA_12' id='FA_12' href='#FN_12' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a> They enjoyed the bison's terror and agony,
and with the improved breech-loader death was dealt in a
steady stream, easily and at little cost. It was grand sport!
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Some of our bullets are telling; you can hear them crack on his
hide. There is a red spot now, not bigger than the point of one's
finger, opposite a lung, and drops of blood trickle with the saliva
from his jaws.... He is bleeding internally.... Now

he stands sullen glaring at us. The wounds look like little points of

roll and swell with pain and fury.... See him blow the blood

When finally the railways began to push across the plains,
passengers would amuse themselves by shooting buffalo from
the windows. The animals had a habit of trying to cross the
track ahead of the engine, and sometimes would rush beside the
train a long distance, for in the early days trains had to run
slowly, thus giving passengers the opportunity. If the train
did not stop, the herd would perhaps butt up against it, so the
engineers learned to stand still, and, with due respect, wait for
the bison to pass. When wounded, they became dangerous,
especially the vigorous bulls, and the novice then had to look
sharp for his own life, like the <i>matador</i> in the bull-ring.
</p>

<p>
The advance of one of the enormous herds was a terrific
sight. Great clouds of dust rolled up, there was bellowing
and bawling, and the thunder of the thousand hoof-beats on
the hard ground. The herd came as one animal, sweeping
everything before it as an avalanche descends some precipice
in the Alps. "Their lion-like fronts and dangling beards—their
open mouths and hanging tongues—as they come puffing
like a locomotive engine at every bound do at first make the
blood settle a little heavy about the heart." Woe to the
caravan or horseman who failed to evade this resistless approach!
The forward animals were borne ahead by the pressure
from behind, and the mass swept on like some tremendous
flood. Should a river or other obstacle come in the way there
was no halt. Whole herds were sometimes dashed to death
over some precipice, or drowned in a river where quicksand
prevented fording or swimming. Four thousand once crossed
the Platte when it was a foot or two deep and full of quicksand.
The animals in the lead mired, but those behind prevented
their return, and rushing on over the ones already
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
entangled in the fatal sands, themselves fell in, till finally the
bed of the stream, nearly half a mile wide, was covered with
dead and dying buffalo, two thousand, at least, having been
killed in the attempt to cross. Gregg<a name='FA_14' id='FA_14' href='#FN_14' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a> asserts that any herd
was easily turned aside, but others give a different opinion,
and judging from all the data, it seems that Gregg's experience
in this particular must have been unusual.

Hunting was done by several methods; first, following
along the outskirts of a herd on a trained and fleet horse and
"cutting out" an animal to shoot; or, by "still" hunting—that
is, creeping up to a herd unobserved and picking animals
off while feeding; or by the surround; or the drive. The
natives were expert in all methods. In the surround they
closed in large numbers on a herd and at a given signal all began
to shoot. They used the bow and arrow and the spear,
and also firearms when they finally acquired them. They were
astonishingly expert with the bow, singling out their animal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
while riding full speed and sending an arrow entirely through
the victim. Sometimes the arrow would also kill a calf or another
buffalo before ceasing its flight. The spear was skilfully
used, and it is said an Amerind would ride alongside a cow
allowing his spear to rest on its back till it became accustomed
to it and then he would thrust the weapon into the vitals and
deftly withdraw it, all without even slackening his horse's
speed, the horse being trained to guide by the movement of
his rider. Large numbers were captured by building a sort of
corral with wing-like sides of bushes fifty feet apart and a mile
or two long, or more, leading to the entrance. The hunters
closed in gradually on a herd and drove them into the corral,
other men being stationed behind the bushes to frighten the
buffalo. Hind describes vividly his visit to one of these
scenes<a name='FA_15' id='FA_15' href='#FN_15' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"A sight most horrible and disgusting broke upon us as we ascended
a sand dune overhanging the little dell in which the pound
was built. Within a circular fence 120 feet broad, constructed of
the trunks of trees, laced with withes together and braced by outside
supports, lay tossed in every conceivable position, over two hundred
dead buffalo. From old bulls to calves of three months old, animals
of every age were huddled together in all the forced attitudes of violent
death. Some lay on their backs, with eyes starting from their
heads, and tongue thrust out through clotted gore. Others were
impaled on the horns of the old and strong bulls. Others again,
which had been tossed, were lying with broken backs two and three
deep. One little calf hung suspended on the horns of a bull which
had impaled it in the wild race round and round the pound. The
Indians looked upon the dreadful and sickening scene with evident
delight."

This seems like great slaughter, and so it was, but compared
with the white man out after tongues and hides it was as a
raindrop to Shoshone Falls.

<p>
Another way was to take advantage of the blind impetuosity
of the charge of a herd and lead it over the brink of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
precipice. A man holding upon himself a buffalo skin with
head and horns, and running before the herd toward the precipice,
thus induced the buffalo to follow, as they took him to be
one of themselves. At the brink the man secured himself in
some safe nook, while the herd, forced by the rush from behind,
fell over the cliff and were dashed to death. The hunters
then took what they wished and left the rest to the wolves.
</p>

<p>
The fur companies about 1835, when the beaver began to
fail and they found their next mainstay in buffalo robes, annually
sent to market about a hundred thousand. Add to this
a greater number killed by all parties for various purposes, and
it is reasonable to estimate the number yearly destroyed at not
less than a quarter of a million. When the value of robes fell
off, the buffalo was killed for hides and tallow. Eventually
the price of hides fell to no more than one dollar apiece, delivered
in Leavenworth. Made into leather, the bison hides
could not compare with those of domestic cattle. It was soft
and spongy and not adapted for shoe, for sole, or for harness
leather. Large quantities were at one time finished by American
tanners, but were chiefly used for making horse collars.
A good deal was exported to Great Britain. The process of
tanning was the same as for ordinary leather. But no method
of tanning robes with the hair on could equal that of the
natives, and this was admitted by the best American tanners,
who turned out few robes for this reason. The Amerind
method was first to scrape off the superfluous flesh with a sort
of bone adze, the skin being either stretched on a frame or
pegged out on the ground. When dry the surface was rubbed
and scraped again and then covered with the brains and rolled
up flesh side in for three or four days, the brains of the animal
being sufficient for its own hide. Then it was soaked in water
and softened by working and rubbing, thoroughly smoked over
a fire of rotten wood, and finally rubbed down to a finish. A
large hide was often split in two for convenience in dressing
and then sewed together after completion of the tanning
process.
</p>

<p>
One hardly thinks of Washington Irving as a sportsman
and buffalo hunter, yet he was out on the plains in 1832 gaily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
charging after buffalo with pistols of the old priming-pan pattern,
for breech-loaders were not yet in use, and many of the
early trappers had only the old flint-lock. It was the breech-loading
repeater and canned goods that finished the buffalo.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"There is a mixture of the awful and the comic [says Irving] in
the look of these huge animals as they bear their great bulk forwards
with an up-and-down motion of the unwieldy head and shoulders;
their tail cocked up like the cue of Pantaloon in a pantomime, the
end whisking about in a fierce yet whimsical style, and their eyes
glaring venomously with an expression of fright and fury."

Now that the excitement was over I could not but look with commiseration

The scurrying herds sometimes ran close to a caravan and
mules, horses, and oxen have been known to run away with
them. The buffalo often seemed to consider the domestic animals
part of their own herd and the cattle appeared to hold
the same opinion of the buffalo. Indeed, there was little
difference except in appearance between a herd of domestic
cattle and one of buffalo. The mingling was prevented by
firing into the buffalo and killing several, which served to
turn a small herd, though frequently their headway was so
great they could not be swerved and the animals were stampeded
with them. Then hours of hard work became necessary
to rescue the tame animals, and some never were regained.
The season had much to do with the manageability of a herd,
as at some periods the bulls were extremely fierce.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In summer the bulls would find wet places in the prairie
and soon by ploughing and wallowing would create a considerable
puddle, wherein they would lave themselves and finally
emerge coated with mud. Others would follow till a great
depression was the result. These depressions were called
wallows and the plains were covered with them. When filled
up eventually by the washings of the rains they induced, by
superior fertility, a rank growth which distinguished them for
a long distance.

The Osages and other tribes at one time wove blankets of
buffalo wool in the same manner that the Navajos to-day
weave blankets of sheep's wool. Many tribes lived by and
with the buffalo, having no other source of food, shelter, or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
raiment, and this animal became to them the most important
being in creation. It entered into their ceremonials and into
almost every act of their daily life. When no buffalo had
been secured for a time and the camp was growing hungry,
the Buffalo Dance was performed and, as Catlin says, it never
failed to bring the buffalo, because it was invariably continued
till buffalo came in sight—a happy event signalled by a lookout
"throwing" his robe. All then rushed to the hunt. If a
white buffalo cow were taken,—and there were occasionally
white buffalo,—the skin was preserved as a sacred object by the
Dakota tribes. It was sheltered under a special sacred tent and
carried about from camp to camp with the greatest reverence.

The buffalo was easily domesticated, but the Amerind
never seems to have attempted to tame it, although Gomara
states that a certain tribe living in north-western Mexico about
latitude 40°—wherever that might have been—had herds of
tame bison. In the north-west counties of Virginia early in
the nineteenth century a mixed breed was common, and in the
first settlement of the North-west there was also crossing with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
European cattle. The cows of this mixed breed that were
considered best for milking were the half bloods down to the
quarter or even eighth of buffalo blood. But it may be assumed
that had there been any considerable gain by the cross
the experiment would have been continued. It seems probable
in view of the physique of each animal that the cross had
heavier forequarters and lighter hindquarters than either
parent, and a lighter milk yield, hence it would not be found
advantageous.

The calf, Catlin asserts,<a name='FA_17' id='FA_17' href='#FN_17' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a> could be made to follow a horseman
simply by holding the hand over its eyes and breathing
into its nostrils a few strong breaths. In this way he collected
about a dozen, which were fed at the fort on milk and finally
sent down the river to St. Louis as a present to Choteau. All
but one died on the journey. The breathing operation was
not unattended with danger for the calves were vigorous butters
and not lightly to be trifled with. The trapper Pattie,
when crossing the prairies, shot a cow and concluded to take
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
the little calf alive to camp. So he laid aside his equipment
in order the more easily to catch it, expecting a hot chase.
But when he approached the prospective captive it also approached
him, and with the speed and vigour of a battering
ram. Mr. Pattie found himself stretched on the ground, with
the further misfortune of being knocked back again every time
he attempted to rise. He began to suspect that his final hour
had come, when he succeeded in catching the calf by one of
its legs, and killed it with his sheath knife, which was still in
his belt.
</p>

<p>
The pursuit of the buffalo was full of excitement and within
reason was a legitimate sport. Catlin exclaims: "I have always
counted myself a prudent man, yet I have waked (as it were)
out of the delirium of the chase, into which I had fallen as into
an agitated sleep, and through which I had passed as through
a delightful dream, where to have died would have been but
to have remained riding on without a struggle or a pang."
</p>

<p>
The herds of buffalo were always followed by large numbers
of wolves, both the small coyote variety and the huge grey
wolf. There were also on the prairies in great numbers what
the early frontiersmen called "white bears." These were
grizzlies. They were very bold and many a man was sent to
the Happy Hunting Grounds by their ferocious power. No
animal in the world perhaps, taken all in all, was so dangerous.
Besides these there were numerous antelope, elk, deer, sheep,
prairie hens, turkeys, quail, rabbits, and other small game,
more or less familiar to the reader, and, therefore, not requiring
an extended description here. The beaver and the buffalo
were the animals of the greatest importance; and the buffalo
deserves a place in our national emblem along with the beaver,
for the bones of the bison may be said to form one of the
corner-stones of the Union.

<p>
Of more than equal interest with the magnificent wilderness
and its animal occupants was the human dweller within
its broad limits, the Amerind,<a name='FA_18' id='FA_18' href='#FN_18' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a> commonly called the Indian.
Still another name for him was Red Man, yet he was neither
an Indian nor was he red, except when he painted himself with
ochre and vermilion. His real colour was various shades of
brown or bronze, rather yellowish than red where protected
from the sun. We are not surprised that roses of different
hue grow in a garden, but there has always been unwarranted
amazement that different shades of men should be found in the
garden of the universe. There appears to be no reason why
men should not vary in colour as well as all other animals and
plants. But though races of mankind may vary in colour they
never, so far as now determined, have varied in any other essential;
or at least only slightly in fundamental characteristics.
In general physical composition all men to-day are identical,
and there is no certain evidence that they have ever differed
more than they now do.<a name='FA_19' id='FA_19' href='#FN_19' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a> Man is everywhere the same as far

back in the ages as he can be traced. Some may be stronger,
or larger, or shorter, than others, with brains more or less
developed, but they are all practically alike, even to their
emotions.

<p>
Races, as a whole, differ from each other, in their ability to
make machines, in their ability to secure comfort, in language,
and in their social regulations; differences of degree. These
qualities are begun and fostered more by stimulating circumstances
than by particular superiority of race. For example,
the Europeans forged ahead mainly because they were possessed
of animals easily domesticated that would supply their
needs. The Amerind had no such animals in North America
except the bison and the dog. The latter he utilised to the
full as a draught and pack animal, as a wool producer, and as
a supply of animal food. Why he did not domesticate the
bison is a problem. Perhaps it was because there were too
many of them. The store of animal food was usually over-abundant
with all Amerinds living in the range of the buffalo,
so there was no spur to economy. We may imagine that if
the buffalo from time to time had appeared in comparatively
small numbers in the thickly populated country of the Aztecs
where animal food was so scarce that an elaborate system of
human sacrifices developed to supply this deficiency, the latter
eventually would have been abandoned and captive buffalo
substituted for captive man. Domestication, to guard the
supply, would then have been an easy step. But the buffalo
was permitted to roam at will, and the dog remained the sole
domestic animal in possession of the people of North America
before the arrival of the white race.<a name='FA_20' id='FA_20' href='#FN_20' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a>
</p>

<p>
The Amerind was not a savage. He was a barbarian with
a rather well ordered society. He possessed a high quality of
intellect, and he differed from his white antagonist more in external
complexion than in any other particular except his social
organisation, which was one the white man had passed through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
and left behind in centuries far past. But the Amerind had
the same emotions. He loved his home, his family,—as constituted
by his social regulations,—and his children. As to
honesty and dishonesty, the balance was certainly not far from
even, average for average; if anything, the Amerind had more
respect for the ideals of his race than was the case with the
white man with reference to his. Of course he had abundant
vices like all the rest of humanity. He was often horribly
cruel to his enemies. But on the whole he was not worse than
the European who brought him degradation; who frequently
soaked him with cheap rum and alcohol, in order more easily
to exchange nothing for valuable furs: who engrafted upon
him more and worse vices, who shot him needlessly, and who
reviled him as he sank helpless under the heavy tide of imposition.
Love of home and defence of country are ever extolled
as of the highest merit in the white race; in the American
native they were crimes. From the beginning of the contact
the Amerind began to change for the worse.

<p>
The white man blamed all Amerinds for every crime and
the Amerind blamed the white man similarly. Each visited
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
retribution on the other without discrimination. The antagonism
grew and grew. Tribes which at first received the whites
most kindly and were continually cheated were apt to become
bitterest enemies. On the Missouri in 1810 Wilson Price Hunt
asked some Amerinds why they killed white men, to which
they answered, "because they kill us—that man—" pointing
to Carson—"killed one of our brothers last summer." This
statement was true. Carson while with the Arikara had shot,
probably for amusement, across the river at a war party of
Sioux. The latter then retaliated by killing three whites. In
this way the mutual antagonism multiplied as the years passed,
just as a snowball increases when it rolls down hill. The native
soon discovered that he must apply himself to his protection,
and from being comparatively peaceful he became intensely
warlike, emulating the example of the Iroquois and Apache.
Had he possessed the power of organising, the story of white
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
encroachment on his domain would have read differently. As
it is, it may be considered a great loss to history that we have
so little of the story from his point of view.

<p>
Before the nineteenth century was half over, the country
east of the Mississippi was entirely appropriated by the whites.
The various tribes that had lived there were absorbed, exterminated,
or crowded out; the same process was to be repeated
in the Wilderness. The Iroquois held their ground in New
York and succeeded in exchanging their former holdings for
small reservations; and here was another story of the white
man's perfidy. The Seminole, the Creek, and the Sac-and-Fox
tribes were finally crushed and their remnants removed,
with others, beyond the Mississippi. The general government
as a rule tried to deal justly by the Amerind, yet it has been
much censured. Its task was an impossibility as long as so
many white men who came in contact with the natives were
willing to set aside every principle of fair dealing and treat
them with no more consideration than they did the beaver and
the buffalo. They wanted their furs and anything else of
commercial value that they possessed, and no subterfuge was
too dishonourable to practise on them. The matter for surprise
is not that the Amerind was occasionally on the war-path,
but that he was not always there. He received daily lessons
in cupidity, cruelty, and dishonour.
</p>

<p>
Thus far the most exact basis for the classification of these
interesting people has been language. It was some time after
the early intercourse with the natives of the East before the
wide divergence in language was appreciated and all attempts
to classify them fell into confusion. Finally, in 1836, Albert
Gallatin began an arrangement by language which, reorganised
by Powell, in 1885-86, has been generally adopted by ethnologists,
and to-day, while not entirely approved, it is the only
method that is satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
By this system all tribes whose language roots are the same
are classed together no matter how widely separated geographically
they might have been. Notwithstanding the remarkable
homogeneity of all the aboriginal inhabitants of the
continent in customs, habits, and organisation, yet more than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
sixty separate stock languages were discovered in North
America. Each one of these is taken to represent a "stock"
group to which is given a title derived from Gallatin's first
designation or from the leading tribe in that particular stock,
with the addition of "an" or "ian," and all tribes having
similar language roots are classed with this group or stock.
Thus in the Siouan stock, the title is taken from the leading
tribe, the Sioux, and all affiliated languages are brought under
the same heading, as Dakota, Crow, Hidatsa, Iowa, Mandan,
etc., and in the Athapascan the title is taken from the Athapascas
of the far north, while the Apaches and Navajos of the
south are classed under the same heading, as they speak
related languages.<a name='FA_21' id='FA_21' href='#FN_21' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a>

<p>
It so happened that the Wilderness possessed a greater
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
variety of these stock groups than any other part of the continent,
one portion, that lying west of the Sierra Nevada,
containing an astonishing number of small groups living contiguously,
yet each speaking a totally distinct language. It
was therefore often difficult for the early invaders to make
themselves understood, as well as to understand. Among the
Amerinds themselves a "sign" language existed which was of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
remote origin and which was convenient and expressive for
intercourse between tribes speaking radically different tongues.
Sometimes a third language served to convey ideas between
tribes or between them and white men, this third language
being one belonging to some widely diffused stock of the region.
Still another language was one which grew up spontaneously,
composed of words from two or more languages as
well as of a lot of words which in one way or another originated
themselves, a mongrel language perfectly understandable but
made up of flotsam and jetsam. Of this class the most widely
used and best known was that called Chinook jargon, originating
in the Columbia river region and composed of words from
many different languages, including those of the white man,
as well as words that never existed anywhere else.
</p>

<p>
Taking language as a basis, we find the Wilderness divided
mainly between two great families, or stocks, which had grown
numerous and were able to spread over a vast extent of country,
though each contained a large number of separate tribes
often at war with each other, at least after the arrival of the
whites. These two stocks were the Siouan and the Shoshonean.
Of the first, some leading members were mentioned
above; of the second, the Shoshone, Comanche, Ute, and
Moki (or Shinumo) were representative, in fact comprised
almost the entire stock. The Siouan division, or family,
ranged from the banks of the Mississippi westward, with its
lower border stretching diagonally from south-eastern Arkansas
as far as our present Yellowstone Park, north to the upper
boundary of the United States and beyond. They were
flanked above by tribes of another stock, widespread and
powerful, north to Hudson Bay and east of the Mississippi,
the Algonquian, represented by the Blackfeet,<a name='FA_22' id='FA_22' href='#FN_22' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a> Chippewa,
Knisteneau (or Cree), and others. South of the Siouan range
came that of the Caddoan, in south-western Arkansas, the
eastern half of Texas, and in Louisiana with a central group
in the midst of the Siouan range, in southern Nebraska, and a
northern one also surrounded by the Siouan people, in North
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
Dakota. The northern was the Arikara (or Ree), the middle
the several sub-tribes of Pawnee, and the southern the Caddo,
Wichita, Kichai, and others. Adjacent to the central Caddoan
group, on the west, was another section of Algonquian stock,
the Cheyenne and Arapaho, and just north of this came the
Kiowan, represented by the tribe from which the stock name
comes, the Kiowa. This tribe was intimately associated with
the Comanche, and there was a strong similarity in language.

<p>
West of all these ranged the Shoshonean stock from the
middle line of Texas north-westward almost to the State of
Washington, west to the Sierra Nevada, and south-westward
like an inverted U around other stocks in New Mexico and
Arizona, sending a slender arm entirely across California to
the sea. This stock occupied a large part of the territory once
claimed by Spain and Mexico, while the Siouan covered the
major part of what was the Louisiana wilderness. Immediately
south of the country of the Shoshonean tribes lay that
of some branches of another numerous people already mentioned,
the Athapascan, whose main body was far to the north,
spreading across the whole extreme north-western part of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
continent through Alaska, almost to the coast, which was occupied
by a narrow fringe of Eskimauan people. These southern
Athapascans, known as Apache and Navajo, were thus a long
way from any relatives, but no people on the continent were
better able to look out for themselves, both being warlike from
the first, though this tendency was aggravated by the impositions
of the early whites. The Navajo appear to have been
considerably changed by an admixture of other blood, which
may be termed Puebloan,<a name='FA_23' id='FA_23' href='#FN_23' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a> the term in this case being used not
to designate people with similar language, but with similar
culture and social organisation. The Apache, by his swiftness
of action, his mobility, and his general skill as a predatory
warrior, kept the more peaceful tribes in a state of constant
turmoil and terror. At the same time he seems originally to
have received the whites fairly well. In some ways he resembled
the Iroquois, yet he had no approach to their masterly
organisation.
</p>

<p>
Below the Athapascan group of the present New Mexico
and Arizona was the Piman, a peaceful agricultural people,
whose main range was in Mexico; and lying between the
Piman and the Shoshonean was the northern part of the
Yuman country, their southern range being the peninsula of
Lower California.
</p>

<p>
Scattered irregularly through the Athapascan district were
the villages of the sedentary Puebloans, a group made up of
tribes speaking different languages but more or less affiliated
by their similarity of habit. They were often at war with each
other. They were house-builders, though that may be stated
with regard to many of the tribes of other stocks. Their
houses, however, were erected, with a view to greater permanency
than any others, of adobe clay, or of stone, for their
country was deficient in game and in forest, and they relied
largely, chiefly indeed, upon their crops of maize. These
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
groups are now well known, particularly the seven villages of
the Moki, that of Zuñi, of Taos, and a number of others along
the Rio Grande. The Moki (or Moquis) as stated above are
classed as Shoshonean.<a name='FA_24' id='FA_24' href='#FN_24' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a>
The Zuñi are designated
Zuñian, and
others fall under
Keresan, from Keres
(or Queres), and Tañoan.
When considered
otherwise than
linguistically, the general
term, Puebloan
(really villagers) is useful
for reasons explained
above. The
tribes of this group,
remnants of a once
far more numerous
people, are some of
the most interesting
of all the Amerinds
within our borders.

In the middle of
Texas was the Tonkawan
group, a small
remnant, and at the
southern extremity
the Karankawan, another
small remnant,
and the Coahuiltecan,
named from the Mexican
state, Coahuila. In what is now the State of Louisiana
were several other remnants, the Chittimachan, Natchezan,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
Tonikan, Adaizan, and Attacapan. West of the Sierra
Nevada and extending north to the boundary, was the extraordinary
conglomeration of small stocks, terminating in
the wider-spread Salishan which reached up into British
Columbia.
</p>

<p>
The dwellings of these various tribes had a great deal of
variety. It was popularly supposed for many years that an
"Indian" lived only in a skin tent or a wickiup, or any shiftless
kind of a shelter, consequently when it was discovered
that there were some who had lived centuries ago in rather
well constructed houses which were found in ruins, it was assumed
that these people must have been of another race and
a superior one. The fact that tribes were still building and
occupying houses of the same kind, who were only common
"Indians," was not for years permitted to interfere with the
romance, but now the "vanished-race" theories are pretty well
abandoned except perhaps by visionary writers who do not
understand the field. The ruins were found in canyons and
valleys where natural-rock <i>débris</i> and a poverty of timber and
large skins almost compel house-building. A vast abundance
of gypsiferous clay furnished another excellent building material,
for that climate, and this was utilised in the South-west
where other materials were difficult to secure. They also
rammed this clay mixed with gravel into large wicker frames
which were lifted, after the mass had hardened, to aid in preparing
other blocks on top, so that a sort of clay concrete-block
wall was raised. When the white men first came to the country,
a ruin of one of these large houses called <i><span lang="es_ES">Casa Grande</span></i> stood
in Arizona near the present town of Florence. No one knows
when this structure was erected or abandoned. It is still
standing about as first described by whites. The government
has assumed its care and protection.

<p>
The Mandan built a large round earth-covered wigwam
which was substantial and comfortable. The Dakota developed
the portable tipi. The Shoshone lived in skin tents and huts
of boughs, as did the Comanche. The tribes of the North-west
built strong houses of slabs, often very long. The tribes of
California built of brush and slabs. Each people constructed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
a habitation in accordance with the facilities of the region they
occupied, and while house-building may indicate a certain
superiority of social advancement it is no mark of race differentiation.
Tribes of one stock built good houses and lived in
mere brush shelters at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Some of the occupied villages became of great importance
in the early days of white intrusion, notably Taos, a pueblo on
the headwaters of the Rio Grande. This figured prominently
in the events which broke the Wilderness from the time of
Espejo to the acquisition of the region by the Americans, and
is standing to-day.
</p>

<p>
For subsistence the tribes relied on different things depending
on the nature of the country. The Siouan and other
plains people where the buffalo roamed, lived almost exclusively
upon it. The meat was food; the skins raiment and
shelter; the sinew, thread; the robes, beds, and so on. The
Puebloans having few or no buffalo and little game cultivated
maize. Many other tribes also cultivated this grain, particularly
those living along watercourses. In some districts irrigation
had to be resorted to, and the Amerind was equal
to the problem. Where shower waters were insufficient or
could not be turned at once amongst the corn, elaborate
and extensive irrigation canals were constructed, remains of
which have been discovered. One of the largest was found
by modern engineers to be so well placed that they followed
its course for some distance with their canal. The Moki still
plant their corn with a sharpened stick and guide the water
from every shower through the fields.
</p>

<p>
These people had solved the problem of agriculture in an
arid country, long before the Spaniard, or the Mormon, or any
other foreigner planning irrigation had ever set foot on this
continent.

Their manufactures covered a considerable range. They
made clothing and blankets, of wool, skins, and cotton. They
were unsurpassed in basketry; they made excellent pottery.
They originally used as weapons the bow and arrow, the lance,
and various kinds of war clubs. Their beverage was mainly
water, though some knew how to concoct intoxicating drink.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'></a></span>

Where the maple tree grew, its sap and syrup were utilised,
and they also made sugar from it. Salt they obtained from
briny lakes. Of mining they had no knowledge whatever,
nor did they have metals, excepting, near the Missouri, an
occasional fragment of copper.
</p>

<p>
Cooking was done in pits previously heated by large fires,
or in wicker jugs by means of hot stones put inside; or it was
done in earthenware pots. Bread, when made of corn, or of
grass-seed meal, was baked on hot stones. Their musical instruments
were drums, rattles, flutes, and whistles. Of ceremonials
they had a great many. Sometimes these were
sickening ordeals, like the now famous Sun Dance of the
Omaha; or the Moki Snake Dance, where live rattlesnakes
form part of the ritual and are carried about by the Snake
priests, even in their mouths.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding an intermittent and desultory sort of warfare
kept up between tribes of the same stock, as well as of
different stocks, comparatively few were killed in this way before
the European came. Night attacks were seldom made
and in day attacks not many at one time were injured. The
ordinary routine was one of peace. It is probable that in the
American Civil War alone more men were killed than ever at
one time in aboriginal days occupied the same area. Almost
four thousand were destroyed at the battle of Shiloh, and in
the battles of the Wilderness fully fifteen thousand. Even
proportionately the wars of the "savages" were mere child's
play compared to this. But when the white man crossed the
Mississippi and began to encroach from the east and then from
the west and one tribe was forced back upon another as the
wind beats the combing waves upon a lee shore, matters began
to change. A large infusion of inferior white blood aided this
change. Then came the horse! It was a deficiency suddenly
and completely supplied. The warrior on horseback was quite
a different being from the one on foot. The boundless Plains
were circumscribed. And the gun! Another void by this was
so admirably filled that horse and gun and Amerind instantly
merged into one; an indissoluble trio. Henceforth he supplied
himself with an abundance of horses and with the best
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
guns and ammunition he could get, till at the fearful moment
on the Little Big Horn, he was better armed than the white
soldiers sent to overpower him. It is exceedingly difficult
always to view things dispassionately from our antagonist's
standpoint, but when we succeed in doing so we invariably
discover that he has some of the justice and virtue on his side.
The Amerind seen in this way was not half as bad as he has
been painted by his conqueror, who was prone to gloss over
and forget his own shortcomings.

Three Conditions of Wilderness Life—Farming in the Driest Country—The <i>Cache</i>—The
Clan, the Unit of the Tribe—Hospitality—Totems and Totem Marks—Dress—An

</p>

<p>
The daily life of these natives of the Wilderness was regulated
chiefly by the food quest. With reference to this
quest they existed in three general states or conditions:
hunter, fisher, farmer. Sometimes two, sometimes all, these
conditions were combined at one time. But no matter which
condition a tribe might be living in, nor what language it
might speak, its customs and social organisation were surprisingly
similar to those of all the other tribes. So that we have
the picture of numerous tribes dwelling in houses of widely
varying construction, subsisting on food obtained in radically
different ways, and speaking distinctly different languages,
with general habits, customs, and ceremonials almost identical,
yet with the details of the daily routine regulated largely by
the kind of food most easily obtained in their particular locality.
Those in the higher mountains and on the plains were
mostly hunters. The tribes of the plains subsisted principally
on the buffalo, though some few cultivated maize, beans, and
squashes along the Arkansas, the Platte, and the Missouri
river bottoms. To these people of the prairies the horse was
the greatest prize. Those living mainly by fishing were tribes
of the Pacific Coast and along the Pacific river-valleys, like the
Columbia, where the salmon run. Most of this class had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
small use for the horse; many had for him no use whatever,
doing their entire travelling by canoe, and handling this craft
with unsurpassed dexterity.

<p>
Those in the farmer condition were the people of the extremely
arid south-western quarter where large game was scarce,
and where crops of maize and
beans, grown with considerable
difficulty and labour, were the
principle reliance. With maize
as a basis of food supply it was
possible for a tribe to be far
more sedentary than when subsistence
was obtained by the
chase. Hostile neighbours could
be avoided. A whole tribe
could occupy fortifications, like
the Pueblo villages for example,
in the midst of some
wide valley, near a river or
other water supply, or could
retire to some fastness of cliff
or mountain, easily defended,
where ample crops could be
grown on bottom lands, and where recesses in cliffs afforded
sites for secure and comfortable homes, as well as great quantities
of fallen <i>débris</i> for building purposes. Such were hundreds
of villages scattered over the South-west as far north as
the southern parts of Utah and Colorado; and even perhaps to
Salt Lake. There was no need of sallying forth to the confines
of hostile country in search of food; and, before the
coming of the whites placed the gun and horse at the service
of the more predatory tribes, they would not readily risk an
attack on such strongholds.
</p>

<p>
The cultivation of maize was increasing, except on the immediate
Pacific Coast, where it was not cultivated at all. Even
the Pai Utes, who lived largely on grass seeds and edible
plants and roots, had begun to have small gardens where
beans, pumpkins, melons, and maize grew. East of the Mississippi
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
and south of the Great Lakes enormous quantities of
the great staple of the New World were produced before the
white people arrived. Tribes to the north in the region of
Minnesota were beginning to understand its cultivation, and
the importance of having a food supply under control. In the
South-west, for an unknown period, it had been the mainstay.
There it was cultivated by irrigation whereas in the eastern
part of the continent the rainfall was, of course, sufficient. In
the South-west the men did the work in the fields, leaving the
management of
the household
to the women;
even the building
of the houses in
fact. But in districts
where the
products of the
soil formed only
a minor part of
the subsistence,
or where it was
mainly or entirely
wild meat, the
men for so large
a part of their
time were engaged
in the pursuit of game that the camp and household
duties, as well as what tending of crops might be necessary,
fell to the women. Their labours were intermittent, and when
the men returned from the chase, sometimes worn out if game
were scarce, the women waited upon them just as a white
woman waits on her cross husband when he comes home tired
from the shop.

<p>
Besides the various game animals, and maize, beans, squash,
grass seeds, pine nuts, cactus apples, wild potatoes, agave, and
numerous palatable roots and berries, the dog was largely
eaten. Some kinds of young dogs were said, when well
cooked, to be much like pig, but the larger ones were apt to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
be coarse and rank. In addition to these numerous kinds of
food, human flesh was occasionally eaten, but only when in
the pangs of starvation: or as a religious ceremony. When
no water was to be had, the plains tribes would kill a buffalo
and drink the blood. They often also ate the entrails of animals
raw, particularly those of the buffalo, which latter delicacy
Harmon<a name='FA_25' id='FA_25' href='#FN_25' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a> indulged in and speaks of as "very palatable." All
the Amerinds smoked, and with most tribes every consultation
or council or friendly visit was opened by the tobacco pipe.
Indeed the place of tobacco and the pipe among the natives
of the continent was one of the greatest importance. It was
not always what we call tobacco that was smoked, but frequently
the inner bark of the red willow, the leaves of the
manzanita bush, dog-wood bark and sumach leaves, or a plant
resembling garden sage, which according to Beckwourth,<a name='FA_26' id='FA_26' href='#FN_26' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a> grew
wild in the country of the Snakes, but which was cultivated by
the Crows and several other tribes. Most of the Algonquian
tribes grew large quantities of maize, and cooked it with beans
and other things. From them, and their neighbours, we have
derived not only a number of dishes, but their names as well,
such as supawn, succotash, pone, mush, etc.

<p>
Many tribes laid away stores for winter, but these were the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
more sedentary, though dried
buffalo meat, and pemmican,
were accumulated as far as
possible by the tribes living
upon the plains. But when
the diet of a people is confined
to meat alone, an enormous
supply, per capita, is
required for a whole winter,
hence some tribes ran out of
provisions, especially when
the numbers of buffalo began
to diminish, and were in hard
straits before spring came
again. The fisher tribes put
away great amounts of dried
salmon, but here again was
the danger of shortage that
always threatened meat-eaters.
The same might be true
of people living on the products
of agriculture if the
population pressed on the
supply, but with agriculture
the returns are so bountiful
that the supply was always
adequate among those tribes
cultivating the ground, except
there was a failure of
crops, which was rare. The
Puebloans provided against
this by retaining a considerable
extra store from year to
year. They used the lower
inside rooms of the village
which were much like cellars,
as the village, resembling a
pile of huge packing cases,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
was built over and around them. Thus they were admirably
adapted for storage in that dry climate. The ears of corn
were piled up evenly and neatly one beside the other. Watermelons
were treated in the same way, and were preserved in
perfect condition till the end of February at least. Naturally
the tribes which moved about considerably could not well
make such ample provision for the future, but they often
stored food, and other goods in holes dug in the ground, well
concealed. Such storage places were also used by the whites,
and the name <i><span lang="fr_FR">cache</span></i> was applied to this method by the early
French trappers. Where the <i><span lang="fr_FR">cache</span></i> was in dry ground the
contents would remain in good preservation for a long time.

<p>
It is plain that the people of the Wilderness possessed everywhere
an abundant food supply, whether in the arid Southwest,
whereat first glance it would seem no cereal could grow,
in the buffalo country, or in the region of the salmon streams.
It was the preservation of these supplies, over-abundant at certain
times, scarce at others, which was their greatest difficulty.
</p>

<p>
With us the unit of our social organisation is the family:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
father, mother, children. With the Amerind the unit was generally
the clan (or gens) as we call it, a group of several families
related on the mother's side, for descent was usually counted
in the female line. The Omahas and some others had changed
to descent in the male line. The clan held property in common
exactly as one of our families does to-day; that is not all
property, but general property and food. There were articles
and objects which were exclusively individual property and
did not belong to the clan any more than certain articles a
daughter or a son may individually possess belong to the
parents in one of our families. Hunting, farming, and such
affairs were conducted, as a rule, for the clan, hence food was
clan property free to all members, or for that matter to almost
any one, because in the Amerind village, or camp, every house
was open to the hungry guest. The white man was always
fed as well as the supplies would permit; special stews of dog,
or buffalo, or succotash, were prepared for his special delectation,
and he was expected to eat all given him or take it away.
To these people, therefore, it was a rather painful surprise
when, as they began to unravel the peculiarities of their new
acquaintances, they found that the white man was perfectly
willing to accept the boundless hospitality of the native, but
when the latter visited fort or camp, he was received as a beggar.
When the hospitality he expected was not granted, he
asked for it; and this, to a white man, was begging. In dealing
with Amerinds the white man went on the principle of
what is yours is mine and what is mine is my own. Perhaps
there were two exceptions to this, the early French, and the
great Hudson Bay Company.
</p>

<p>
Marriage within the clan was forbidden, therefore a man
had to seek a wife in another clan or another tribe. A violation
of this rule, or of any other moral precept of their code,
brought punishment from the clan of the individual or from
the officers of the tribe. Sometimes this was nothing more
than a flogging; sometimes it was death. A man always retained
allegiance to his own clan and the wife to hers, the
children belonging to their mother's clan. As a rule there was
no limit to the number of wives a man could have, though
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
polygamy was not general. In the Amerind code the <i><span lang="la">bona
fide</span></i> acceptance of a wife was a marriage, and the husband was
expected to assume the duties of a husband seriously. The
white adventurer did not do it. He was quite apt to abandon
his wife as cheerfully as he had taken her.

<p>
The clan had the right to adopt into it any outsider it
pleased, and this right of adoption was frequently exercised.
In this manner white, or other prisoners, or friends, were incorporated
into the clan and therefore into the tribe, taking
the place perhaps of some deceased son or brother, daughter
or sister. The adopted men not infrequently rose to positions
of importance, even to that of head chief. These officers were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
usually chosen because of personal qualifications and achievements,
but it was not uncommon for the title of ordinary chief
to be bestowed on a visitor
as a sort of honorary degree.
There were many
chiefs of varying power
and importance, mostly
military; the office of
sachem, a purely civil position,
was more difficult
to attain, as it was generally
hereditary within
the clan. Because of the
law of maternal descent,
a man's son in most
tribes could not inherit
his father's office. He
might be adopted, however,
by the clan.

<p>
Children were seldom
whipped, yet they were
carefully trained and were
obedient and respectful.
Their parents loved them
just as white parents love
their offspring and in later
days when the Indian Bureau
compelled the children
to attend the agency
schools, there was many a
heart pang and copious
tears all round at the parting.
But the usual theory
was that these people had
no human sensibility.
</p>

<p>
Several families of a
clan often occupied a single structure. Each clan had a
sign, a sort of coat of arms, called a totem, to represent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
it, and this was often used as a signature. Combined with
other pictures it indicated the occurrence of certain events.
It was generally an animal from which in far past times the
clan was supposed to be descended; but there were also personal
totems. The clan took its name from its totem, Bear,
Hawk, etc., and its members frequently held names which
indicated their clan title. The clan controlled its members,
settled disputes, and if one were murdered or committed
murder, the clan prescribed or accepted punishment or settlement
as the case might be. It also argued its case when
necessary by means of representatives before the council of the
tribe. To know a tribe well it was important to know the
workings of the clan system, yet this has generally been overlooked
by all but the ethnologists. A tribe was usually
spoken of by its members as "the men" or "the people," and
these terms were often understood by white men to be the
names of the tribes, and accordingly were so used.

<p>
When at peace these people were kind. The Rev.
Samuel Parker who was on the plains at a very early time,
referring to some who accompanied him declares: "They
are very kind and manifest their kindness by anticipating
all, and more than all my wants." Harmon, who for nineteen
years was a leading member of the North-west Company,
speaking of one village where he passed several days,
is sure he was treated "with more real politeness than is
commonly shown to strangers in the civilised part of the
world."
</p>

<p>
The general dress of the men was leggins of buckskin resembling
the legs of a pair of white man's trousers, attached
to a belt, with frequently a shirt of the same material, though
a great deal of the time there was no covering for the upper
part of the body except a robe or blanket thrown loosely
around the shoulders. The remainder of the costume was a
breech cloth and moccasins of buckskin, the latter with or
without hard soles according to the tribe. In the South-west,
particularly after the Spaniards came, the costume was different.
There leggins came only to the knee, and were made to
button, or were attached by a woven garter twisted around
just under the knee. Above there were short trousers, or
rather breeches of cotton. A cotton shirt with a blanket over
it in cool weather, and a cloth <i><span lang="fr_FR">à la turban</span></i> around the head
completed the dress. No matter if an Amerind wears trousers
as he often did and does, he rarely dispenses with the breech
cloth. In battle the warrior stripped completely, though in
past times some tribes wore armour of slats, rods, or tough
buffalo hide.
</p>

<p>
The woman's dress was a loose gown or tunic of buckskin,
of woollen or of cotton fabric, bound at the waist by a girdle,
and, when travelling or in ceremonials, moccasins with leggins
attached, the latter buckskin strips winding round and round
the leg. In the house or about the village or camp the women
generally went without any covering on the feet. The women
of some tribes wore only a sort of kilt of bark strips. The
younger children in summer wore no clothing; and in some
tribes, particularly those of the mild South-west, neither men,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
women, nor children troubled themselves about covering.
The manner of wearing the hair was always significant; caps
and head-dresses were also worn.
</p>

<p>
In moving camp the plains tribes usually took their whole
tent with them, the poles, before they had the horse, being
tied on each side of their dogs by means of a sort of saddle
made for the purpose. Moving was far easier after
the horse arrived, for not only could he pull the poles of the
tent tied to his back, but also upon them he could drag the
children, the tent cover, and the general household goods;
furthermore, the mother could ride on the horse. The <i><span lang="fr_FR">travois</span></i>
was, therefore, a different affair with the horse to drag it
than it was with the dog; but they did not abandon utilising
the dogs and they were often harnessed to light loads on
the poles. The horse, then, was not only an essential in war
and the chase, but also in the journeys from one locality to
another.
</p>

<p>
They knew well their own land and its limits. We sometimes
forget this. Francis La Flesche, an educated Dakota,
writes with reference to their knowledge:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The white people speak of the country at this period as a
wilderness as though it was an empty tract without human interest
or history. To us Indians it was as clearly defined then as it is to-day;
we knew the boundaries of tribal lands, those of our friends
and those of our foes, we were familiar with every stream, the contour
of every hill, and each peculiar feature of the landscape had its
tradition. It was our home, the scene of our history and we loved
it as our country."<a name='FA_27' id='FA_27' href='#FN_27' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Tabbaquena, a head chief of the Comanches whom Gregg
interviewed, drew for him a map, with paper and pencil, and
"although the draft was somewhat rough it bore much to our
astonishment, quite a map-like appearance, with a far more
accurate delineation of all the principal rivers of the plains,
the road from Missouri to Santa Fé and the different Mexican
settlements than is to be found in many of the engraved maps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
of those regions." Pike and other early explorers might have
saved themselves vast trouble had they employed such a man
to accompany them. This was not always easy, however, for
sometimes when the native was perfectly willing to draw a
map, or otherwise describe a route, nothing could induce him
to leave his people, and even if he did go, he would frequently
tire of his job and
slip away.

<p>
In all the history
of the Wilderness
only one explorer has
travelled where the
modern Amerind did
not go and that one
was Major Powell
when he descended
the Colorado. The
natives of his time
entered the various
canyons here and
there, but they never
remained in them
or navigated their
waters. Long years
ago clans lived within
their fastnesses and
knew them well, but
before the eventful
journey of Powell<a name='FA_28' id='FA_28' href='#FN_28' class='fnanchor'>[28]</a>
they had vanished. As winter approached those tribes that
had been roving during the mild season selected for the
winter comfortable village sites near wood and water and prepared
for a long stay. Other tribes whose general village
life was more stationary arranged their food supply and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
provided for stormy weather. If the shadow of famine
did not fall on the camp time passed pleasantly, the long
evenings being devoted to visiting from tipi (tepee) to tipi,
or from house to house, and the crisp air resounded with
merry laughter, shouts, and singing. Games of different
kinds were played, and certain gifted story tellers kept their
audiences nightly in a roar with vivid tales—some true,
some made for the occasion out of whole cloth. The
Pueblos practised their ceremonial songs, and at times the
boom of the great drum quivered constantly on the evening
air, when perhaps no other sound was audible. The Pueblo
adobe and stone walls being thick all ordinary sounds were
prevented from passing out, hence, as a rule, evening closed
in silently, particularly in winter when doors were shut
against the cold. This was more the case after the whites
came, for before that event there were no doors, the openings
being filled by blankets or skins. The doorways then were
much smaller, to exclude cold air, storm, animals, enemies,
and this gave rise to stories of dwarfs, that have from time to
time appeared.

In the villages where the walls were no more than the thickness
of the buffalo-hide covering the tipi poles, the hilarity
rang out and made the locality extremely gay. The popular
notion that these people were gloomy and fierce in daily life is
a delusion. They were as happy and full of larks as children,
and probably no people ever more appreciated a joke. A
little thing would sometimes cause great merriment. I remember
on one occasion, a good many years ago, when encamped
near Fort Defiance, I was standing one evening in
front of my tent when an old Navajo was seen approaching
who was particularly afraid of a camera. I had in my hand a
small hand camera, and as a joke I ran toward him pointing
it as if to photograph him, although the light had nearly vanished
and a negative could not have been made except by very
long exposure. The Navajo did not know this and much to
the amusement of his compatriots who were standing around
to the number of perhaps a score, he began to dodge about in
the wildest fashion, trying to avoid my advance. For some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
moments I kept up the play, because they were all having
such a jolly time except the victim; and he did not seem
seriously to mind the chase. Apropos of this subject, Fowler,<a name='FA_29' id='FA_29' href='#FN_29' class='fnanchor'>[29]</a>
when crossing the plains met with an incident, also illustrative
of their appreciation of fun. He wore spectacles and had
broken one of the glasses. One day while at a native settlement,
he felt some one steal the spectacles from his eyes and
run away with them. He
thought they were lost for
good, but presently he heard
a great uproar of shouts and
laughter, and then saw the
man who had taken them advancing
and leading another
with the "specs" on his
face. On closer approach
Fowler saw that the led
person was blind in the eye
corresponding to the broken
glass; and the joker signified
that the "specs" suited his
friend much better than they
did Fowler. Then amidst
great good humour they
were returned to him.

In some portions of the
South-west, cotton was cultivated
and woven into blankets and garments long before
the white man came. The Pueblo men did the weaving
in that division; among some tribes the women did it. The
loom was a simple affair, made of a couple of slender logs,
or thick boughs, and several sticks with an arrangement of
cords. It is still in use by the Navajo and the Moki people.
Among the Moki the men set up the loom in the kiva, a sort
of club room entirely devoted to the men, whereas among
the Navajo, women usually weave under a flimsy shelter of
boughs. The Navajo builds no substantial house, because
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
he will never live in a structure in which any one has died.
Probably some such idea retarded many tribes from building
more permanently.

It was a sorry day when the trader brought them alcohol.
By its use tribes were degraded, swindled, beggared.
Occasionally some energetic chief would raise an objection,
even to the point of a fight with his people, but it was
like a man raising his hand to halt the north wind. The
whites wanted the goods the native had, and they wanted
them for nothing. Alcohol and water were next to nothing.
Porcupine Bear, a Cheyenne, once protested so vigorously
that he and a brother chief came near to mortal combat. He
was overruled, and like Rip Van Winkle, they all agreed not
to count that time. Very soon every one was full of whiskey,
not excepting the noble Porcupine Bear himself. The traders
poured tallow into the bottom of the measuring cup so that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
it should hold less than the stipulated amount, also putting
thumbs and fingers in to cunningly accomplish the same cheat.
</p>
<p>
As to population, it is difficult to form an exact estimate.
Undoubtedly in early times the number of natives in the
region forming the United States was exaggerated; the tendency
now appears rather to go to the other extreme. The
dwellings having been mostly of perishable materials there is
little to indicate former population outside of the mounds of
the Mississippi valley, and the house ruins of the South-west.
The latter are so numerous as to testify either to residence for
an immense period or to a population of considerable size. It
was probably both. While these village sites were often only
repetitions by the same people at different times, yet there are
so many of them that there must also have been a goodly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
number of clans and tribes. Whole areas, like the region lying
immediately north of the Colorado River, exhibit multitudinous
remains, but, when white men first went there, only a few
scattered bands of Pai Utes were found, who built nothing
but brush wickiups.

The time when the others expired has never been even approximately
established. It may have been one, two, three, any
number of centuries before our occupation. In that climate a
house ruin might endure ages with hardly a noticeable change.
But there are certain points leading to the belief that some of
the depopulating was of sudden occurrence, and as diseases
brought by the Europeans early spread from Mexico, and as
sedentary people closely grouped would suffer even more than
tribes living in open camps, it appears reasonable to assume
that smallpox and kindred diseases ravaged the whole Wilderness
soon after the landing of Cortez, and were particularly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
disastrous in the South-west. Nothing in the shape of skeletons
would remain to tell the tales of destruction, because
wolves and dogs would devour the bodies and scatter the
bones. As they will dig a body out of a grave and strew the
bones far and wide, dragging one from a house would be
simple. When the smallpox finally swept through the plains
tribes, in historical time, they were wofully reduced in numbers.
Many killed themselves to avoid the lingering horrors.

Probably
there was
never a dense
population,
yet there
might have
been, say,
three or four
hundred thousand
all told,
in the Wilderness.
This, with perhaps, six or seven hundred thousand
east of the Mississippi, would give a total aboriginal population
for the area of the United States of about a million.<a name='FA_31' id='FA_31' href='#FN_31' class='fnanchor'>[31]</a>
The estimate of Major Powell was under three-quarters of a
million. A quarter of a million are left, and they are not decreasing,
for though they are very poor as a rule, owing to the
destruction of their game and other food supplies and to their
having no means of earning money, yet contagion no longer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
destroys them as of old, and wars are a thing of the past.
They are now, however, a different people from those occupying
the country at the beginning of the sixteenth century.
</p>

<p>
To their enemies they were often horribly cruel, to those
of their own hue as well as those who were white. And they
learned speedily that the white man was much the same as
themselves in this regard. They no longer burn victims at the
stake, but the white man who, in the earliest time gave them
fearful lessons in this art, still continues it; even within sight
of our temples of justice. Their wars were multiplied by the
compression of their free territory, which was the result of the
white man's arrival, and by the impositions of the newcomers.
There was one locality, a strip lying along the eastern base of
the Rocky Mountains, which appears to have been a sort of No
Man's Land, and this was called the "Hostile Ground," and
the "War Road." Any one wandering in this tract was always
in danger of attack from many directions.
</p>

<p>
If a war party met with failure it would try to recover its
prestige by attacking whatever came in its way, but if it were
successful, all but the enemy it had originally proceeded against
were comparatively safe.
</p>

<p>
A successful band reaching the borders of its home camp
would send a runner in with the announcement, when the
people would turn out to form a triumphal procession, and
the braves decked themselves out in war-bonnets, war-shirts,
etc., kept for such parades. One with his face blackened carried
a long pole from which the bloody scalp-trophies dangled,
and these were saluted with shouts of joy. At the same time
they were reviled as enemies. This pole was planted in front
of the lodge of the head chief, where later the scalp-dance and
other ceremonies were performed. Many tribes removed all
their hair but a solitary lock, called the scalp-lock in consequence,
left for the benefit of the enemy. The number of
scalps a warrior could boast was the gauge of his military importance
in the tribe. But when the war party returned in
defeat, the camp became a pandemonium of wailing, and
moaning, and gnashing of teeth. Women chopped off fingers
by way of mourning; tore their flesh; and braves also shockingly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
mutilated themselves. Then nothing short of a success
in war could wash out the disgrace.

One hardly can believe that a large number of these people
once had their villages and their farms east of the Mississippi,
where the factory and the mowing-machine now hold sway,
but in the South-west wherever we tread we discover some indication
of the old population: a trail, an irrigating ditch, a
tree for a ladder, house walls, rock pictures, etc., and often,
far from the tumult of the modern world, we seem almost to
catch the sigh of a voice, or the rustle of a blanket, in the
breeze that whispers through the old piñon tree. On the East
Mesa of the Mokis we appear to command a clear perspective,
for the modern world is not evident. I always seemed there to
be far out of it. Through their windows we can well see into
the past and reconstruct the wilderness. Sitting on the housetop
at the day's end, the surf of our restless civilisation beating
against the far horizon, the vanished sun burnishing with a
wondrous spread of gold the whole high vault of the Arizona
sky, we drowsily follow the fading light as it dissolves in a
sea-like mist the plains so far below, till they no longer have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
being but float from its firm moorings, the great headland—villages,
rocks, and all—drifting it backward through phantasmal
centuries. And out of the strange houses around us,
where the mothers sing their lullabies, arise the forgotten
hosts of other days, with the cry of the chase and the clash of
battle, as if like Don Roderick we had unlocked the fateful
gates of the Forbidden Tower and were about to be overwhelmed.
Suddenly, amidst the turmoil of that ancient
throng we discover a greater commotion. It is the European
with his hand of iron, shooting as he marches, while through
the smoke of his gun rises, like the Spectre of the Brocken, a
hideous companion he does not see. It is the dismal Shadow
of Death, smiting right and left; and they walk on together,
ever over corpses.

<p>
As the harmless little snow-birds flit before the advance of
winter's desolation, so a few hapless Spaniards cast up
by the sea were forerunners in the Wilderness of the pressing
swarms of Europe. These men were a small remnant of the
expedition which Panfilo de Narvaez in 1527 led with rosy
banners for the conquest of Florida, where a few years before
Ponce de Leon, instead of his sought-for waters of perpetual
youth, had found a shroud. Three years had barely passed
when the same grave-garment was enwrapping Narvaez and his
band, twining through one disaster after another, till the lonely,
shimmering sea offered the only pathway from under the dark
presence. Then it was a kingdom for a boat! Yet the staggering
band had no tools, nails, cordage, skill; nothing in fact
wherewith to prepare for the combat with Neptune. But the
resolution of despair is great. They gathered spurs, bridle
bits, all the iron they had, and made tools and nails. Spanish
accoutrements were ever elaborate, so they were able to put
their boats firmly together, and with shirts sewed one to another
for sails, and their muscles fortified by the meat of the
horses which they had eaten, whose manes and tails furnished
ropes, at last in five large boats they coasted westward hoping
valiantly to sight some camp, or settlement, of their fellow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
countrymen who, from the capital of the Aztecs, had been
striving to penetrate the Northern Mystery.<a name='FA_32' id='FA_32' href='#FN_32' class='fnanchor'>[32]</a>
</p>

<p>
Seven or eight years only, it is true, had passed since this
same luckless leader so ignominiously had failed in his errand
from Cuba to arrest Cortez, but the Spaniards, besides annihilating
the Mexican Confederacy, had founded some settlements
towards the north, and it was these, their knowledge of distance
being necessarily hazy, that the unfortunates expected
to reach. After many days of weary toil and suffering, they
passed the mouth of the Mississippi which Pineda, about
twenty years earlier, had discovered and named the Rio de
Espiritu Santo. No Holy Spirit was it to these baffled wayfarers,
for its strong current brought confusion and separation.
The boat of Narvaez reached land, the fate of two is not mentioned,
while the remaining two, one of which was commanded
by Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, who had filled the once important
office of treasurer to the expedition, drifted away together.
After several days a storm threw these apart also and
each was driven along haphazard, yet always keeping towards
the land. Cabeza's craft finally beached itself on the wide
sandy shores of an island, called by those who eluded the
breakers the island of ill-luck, Malhado.
</p>

<p>
Here were natives who treated the castaways in a friendly
way, and their fortunes seemed to slightly brighten; it was but
a rift in the cloud. Attempting to proceed, their boat was
capsized in the surf, and disappeared on the wide bosom of
the Gulf. After a few days some men from one of the other
boats, which had been thrown on another part of the island,
joined Cabeza's party, raising the total number to forty. It
was now November of 1530, and here begins the remarkable
experience which Cabeza de Vaca afterwards wrote down as
well as he could remember it. The account is vague in its
details, giving rise among eminent students to a number of
different opinions, as to Cabeza's exact route.<a name='FA_33' id='FA_33' href='#FN_33' class='fnanchor'>[33]</a> The island

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
Malhado was either Galveston or some other along the north
coast of the Gulf of Mexico between this and the mouth of the
Mississippi. Bandelier places it at the mouth of the Sabine.

<p>
It was decided to send out a search party, and four men
were therefore dispatched on the hunt for the settlements.
Soon after some disease broke out in the camp which reduced
the thirty-six to fifteen. Then the natives, who were not
otherwise unkind, separated these and they never again all
met. When spring once more turned the country green, all
the Spaniards but Cabeza de Vaca and one Lope de Oviedo,
who were too sick to travel, again started westward. Cabeza
and Oviedo necessarily remained with the natives, and in spite
of Cabeza's tale of cruelty we can see that he was not very
badly treated, for after awhile he was allowed to make trading
tours into the interior. On these journeys he saw the "hunchback
cows" and learned much about the country, the first
white man to tread that northern soil. In the course of time
he and Oviedo turned their faces westward also and presently
learned from other natives of three men like themselves farther
on. Oviedo lacked the courage to proceed, and he went back
to the first natives they had been with while Cabeza kept on
alone and came to the other Spaniards, the fag-end of the
company that had previously started. They were Andreas
Dorantes, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, and Estevan, an
Arab negro.
</p>

<p>
The Amerinds they were now among did not seem to like
the idea of their departing, but after one or two attempts, the
four succeeded in taking up the broken march for the West.
The tribes they met treated them kindly. In one place a
man came with a headache which Castillo cured by making
the sign of the cross and "commending him to God." Many
more came to be healed, each bringing venison in payment, and
the Spaniards found thereby the road to safety and comfort
as well as to their desired goal. Cabeza even claims to have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
revived the dead; at least he became so proficient as a "medicine
man" that everywhere the natives came to him in large
numbers to be healed. Cabeza was successful, hence his progress
was uninterrupted, but the role of medicine man is sometimes
dangerous to assume. They think that if one is able to
cure a single case, that he can cure all, and if the patient dies
his "medicine" is bad. The reputation of Cabeza grew, till the
progress of the four wanderers was little short of triumphal.
</p>

<p>
Without presenting further details of this first traverse by
white men of a part of the Wilderness, it may be stated that
after passing some mountains, a beautiful river, some rough
dry country, many sorts of people, and divers languages,
through fixed habitations and cultivated fields, they arrived
at a place where the people presented them with a great many
hearts of deer. In consequence they named the spot, Valle de
los Corazones, and it figured conspicuously in the explorations
that were to follow. It was the "entrance to the South Sea,"
that is, it was here they first came to waters flowing into the
Pacific, <i>via</i> the Gulf of California; where, in fact, they crossed
the great divide of the Sierra Madre of Mexico. The river
they reached was the Yaqui. Here, too, they beheld the
first signal of nearing their countrymen in the shape of a
metallic buckle, of Spanish make, while the natives described
white men with beards, of whom, with good cause, they were
much afraid. The Spaniards were slave hunters. A few
days later Cabeza, who with Dorantes and Maldonado resembled
white men no more than did the negro Estevan, met
Spaniards on horseback. They were Captain Alcaraz and
several of his slave-hunting gang. The captain tried to use
Cabeza as a decoy, but he was not successful. Cabeza spread
a warning and his Amerind friends made their escape much
to the wrath of the captain, who thereupon treated them all
badly, and prevented their advance. At last, however, the
four were sent on to the settlement of San Miguel de Culiacan,
where they fell in with that brave and sensible officer, Melchior
Diaz, and their troubles were at an end.
</p>

<p>
These wanderings, so briefly outlined, beginning at the
landing on Malhado, and terminating at Culiacan, covered a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
space of a little over five years. The time of the continuous
journey toward the Pacific Coast was about ten months. The
Narvaez expedition broke up at the end of 1530. Cabeza
started about August, 1535, for Mexico, and arrived among
the Spaniards early in 1536. His general route was across the
southern part of Texas to the Rio Grande, then perhaps some
distance up that stream, and across to the great central mountain
range of Mexico. Bandelier traces the route up the
Conchas and over the pass of Mulatos, but it may have been,
and I believe was, more to the northward.
</p>

<p>
A brilliant picture was now painted for the Spanish people
by the returned wanderers, particularly by the negro Estevan,
who had been specially active in securing information on the
journey, for Cabeza says he "was in constant conversation
with them (the natives), he informed himself about the ways
we wished to take, of the towns that there were, and concerning
the things of which we desired to know."<a name='FA_34' id='FA_34' href='#FN_34' class='fnanchor'>[34]</a> That is,
Estevan practically made himself the guide of the party while
the others attended to the "medicine" business, hence he
could tell a longer story about the "populous towns" of which
the people had spoken. Much was made of these "great"
towns where emeralds were dug out of the mountains, and it
all appeared to confirm earlier rumours of Seven Cities of
fabulous wealth somewhere in the midst of the Northern
Mystery. The fate of Narvaez was now forgotten in the intoxicating
dream of a country rivalling the riches of the Aztecs.
</p>

<p>
There is some confusion as to one or two minor expeditions
then sent northwards; evidently they did not proceed far.
But in 1539 Viceroy Mendoza directed Friar Marcos of Niza
to march under the guidance of Estevan and reconnoitre, with
a view of following this reconnaissance by an elaborate exploration.
Marcos had with him a brother friar and a number
of native Mexicans. Just where he went and what he actually
saw is rather uncertain, but he apparently arrived somewhere
near or in the region now Arizona-New Mexico. Estevan had
gone ahead and was killed for his arrogance at the first Pueblo
village. Marcos soon had word of it and beat a precipitate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
retreat, though he claims to have approached near enough to
view from a hill the wonderful magnificence of the Seven
Cities.<a name='FA_35' id='FA_35' href='#FN_35' class='fnanchor'>[35]</a>

At this time Francis Vasquez de Coronado, an even-tempered
gentleman, but withal a capable one, was governor of
the infant province of New Galicia, and to him came the monk
with so wonderful a tale, that Coronado immediately set out
with the enthusiastic prevaricator for Mexico, and held a secret
conference with Mendoza. But instructions were given to
the clear-headed Melchior Diaz to follow back the friar's trail
and verify his statements, and he proceeded north as far as

Chichilticalli before he was obliged to return on account of

by letter to Mendoza, and with his usual good sense,
he included a careful description of the now notorious Seven
Cities of Cibola, obtained from natives who had lived there
fifteen or twenty years, and some who had been with Estevan
on his disastrous entrada. The account thus derived was absolutely
truthful and accurate; it was likewise a serious damper
on the enthusiasm of the soldiers of the new expedition, for it
became known in spite of efforts to keep it secret. Marcos
again repeated his gorgeous fabrication and expectation once
more rose to the boiling point, for what was the word of a
common officer against that of the distinguished monk!
</p>

<p>
Under Coronado the army went forward early in 1540, "the
most brilliant company," says Castañeda,<a name='FA_36' id='FA_36' href='#FN_36' class='fnanchor'>[36]</a> "ever collected in
the Indies to go in search of new lands"; and three ships were
sent up the coast under Hernando de Alarçon. When they
finally stood aghast before the first "city" of Cibola worn and
famished, many were the curses bestowed on the imaginative
friar, till Coronado, fearing he might be killed, sent him at the
first opportunity back to Mexico. There were no great cities,
no stores of gold, no precious stones; nothing but a common
adobe village. It was easily conquered, and its capture, July
4, 1540, marks the first battle between Amerinds and Europeans
on the soil of the Wilderness, now the region of Arizona-New
Mexico. There was luckily plenty of maize here, and the
hungry Spaniards were sadly in need of it. Though their
dreams received a heavy shock, they soon again expanded
with the hope of better prospects ahead, just as the gambler
repeats his risk with the idea that a turn of luck is sure to retrieve
waning fortune.
</p>

<p>
They heard of other towns called Tusayan (or Tuçano) to
the north-west and men were sent there, one party under Captain
Cardenas continuing on to a great river, the present Colorado,
of which the people told, and these were the first white
men to see the magnificent chasm of the now familiar Grand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
Canyon.<a name='FA_37' id='FA_37' href='#FN_37' class='fnanchor'>[37]</a> About the same time Alarçon, with his ships, endeavouring
to get into communication with Coronado had discovered
and for some distance explored with small boats the
lower part of the same river, calling it the Rio de Buena Guia.
And now Melchior Diaz, with dispatches and the discredited
Friar Marcos, was sent back from Cibola, and ordered to explore
from the valley of the Corazones, wherein was a small
settlement of Spaniards called San Hieronimo, north-westward
to look for Alarçon. This Corazones was evidently the same
valley that Cabeza de Vaca had named.<a name='FA_38' id='FA_38' href='#FN_38' class='fnanchor'>[38]</a> Diaz went across the
north-western corner of Mexico and the south-western corner of
Arizona to the Colorado River, which he reached about eighty
miles above its mouth. Alarçon had already passed down on
his return, but Diaz found letters left by him at the base of a
tree, from which he learned the character of the river. He
determined to explore westward, and went four days beyond
the river which he called Rio del Tizon, because the natives
carried about with them firebrands. He did not know the
name Alarçon had bestowed. While in what is now southern
California he was seriously hurt by a spear which he threw at
an unruly dog, and after twenty days of suffering he died, his
men carrying him back through every danger, as long as life
remained.
</p>

<p>
While these explorations of the Wilderness were going on
under Coronado's command, he heard of more towns, especially a
group, and a single town of the group, called Tiguex, northerly
from Cibola, resting on the banks of a river. Directing the
main army to proceed by the "regular" road, that is, by the
travelled trail, Coronado, with a small escort, struck out by
another route and came to the river below Tiguex at a group
of villages called Tutahaco, and following the river up, reached
Tiguex by that way. The main army by the regular trail
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
passed a remarkable town on a high cliff, called Acuco, usually
identified, I believe wrongly, with Acoma of to-day. At
Tiguex, which was on the Rio Grande, called by Coronado the
"River of Tiguex," somewhere near the present town of Socorro,
probably about fifteen miles below it, the general learned
of still other towns in various directions, for the valley of this
river and the contiguous country was the home of many house-building
Amerinds.<a name='FA_39' id='FA_39' href='#FN_39' class='fnanchor'>[39]</a> One of the important villages called
Cicuye<a name='FA_40' id='FA_40' href='#FN_40' class='fnanchor'>[40]</a> was twenty-five leagues north-east of Tiguex, and
when Coronado went there he met a native from the East
whom the soldiers nicknamed Turk because he resembled one,
and this person actuated by a diabolical object rivalled the
Friar Marcos in tales of great cities and wonderful riches back
in his country, which he called Quivira.
</p>

<p>
Coronado resolved to follow his guidance, so after the
people of Tiguex, who had rebelled at the impudence and
cruelty of the Spaniards, had been subdued, that is, numerously
killed, and the severe winter of 1540-41 was over, preparations
were made for an eastward journey. Other parties
were sent up and down the river of Tiguex, fifty and eighty
leagues respectively. Finally leaving the river, Coronado with
the whole army proceeded by way of Cicuye toward the realm
of lavish wealth the Turk described, but the Turk was only
trying to lure them to destruction on the wide, arid plains, of
Texas, so the route under his lead bore off to the southward
after crossing the Pecos River, till the army was hard pressed
for subsistence. The Turk's trick was discerned, and he was
rewarded by strangulation. Then the main army was sent
back to Tiguex by a direct route, while Coronado with a picked
company continued northerly for a long distance, probably to
within a few miles of the Missouri River, the first white men
to traverse this region, unless, which is not probable, Cabeza
de Vaca, or some of the Narvaez party, may have reached it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Coronado returned to the main camp at Tiguex with the
intention of planning further eastern explorations for the next
year, but in a tilting bout being nearly killed by a fall from his
horse, and with a growing conviction that little more was to
be gained by a longer stay, he decided to abandon all exploration
at this point, and lead his forces back to Culiacan.
</p>

<p>
Every one was disappointed; the army turned its back on
the Wilderness, so pregnant with great possibilities, with a reluctance
akin to that which a confirmed toper might feel on
being obliged to replace the cork before draining the last drop.
But Coronado was right. He had accomplished a remarkable
exploit, and it was time to go back. The country had been
shown to have no ready wealth, it could not then be settled,
and its general topography had been discovered. He displayed
good judgment and fine resolution in adhering to his
decision despite the pleadings of his officers, and the scowls of
the rank and file. Toward the latter part of 1542 they were
again in the Spanish settlements, and the army disbanded.
Mendoza is said by Castañeda to have received Coronado with
great coolness, but this is doubtful.
</p>

<p>
The Seven Cities of Cibola, the first permanent villages
met with in the Wilderness, have been positively identified by
many eminent scholars with the modern district of Zuñi, but
it is a peculiar and persistent error. Tiguex was near Socorro,
and Cibola was southerly from it, so we must look for Cibola
not at Zuñi on the headwaters of the Little Colorado, which
is northerly, but on those of the Gila, in south-western New
Mexico.<a name='FA_41' id='FA_41' href='#FN_41' class='fnanchor'>[41]</a>
</p>

<p>
Many native Mexicans remained at Tiguex and several at
Cibola. Others stopped at still other places. Friar Juan de
Padilla and a lay brother, Luis de Escalona, also desired to remain,
the first going to Quivira, the second to Cicuye, and
Coronado sent an escort as far as Cicuye with them and their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
companions, who were native Mexicans, a Portuguese, and
two negroes, one of whom had his wife and children. Some
sheep, mules, and a horse were also left with them. It has
been stated that there was a third friar, but this appears to be
an error. The Friar Juan de la Cruz mentioned in an old
letter was perhaps only another name for the lay brother Luis,
for neither Castañeda, Jaramillo, nor the letter, mentions
more than two friars. Both were soon killed.
</p>

<p>
The next entrance into New Mexico was by three friars,
Rodriguez,<a name='FA_42' id='FA_42' href='#FN_42' class='fnanchor'>[42]</a> Lopez, and Santa Maria, in 1581, escorted by an
officer named Chamuscado, with eight soldiers. They went at
least as far as Tiguex, where Lopez, and perhaps Rodriguez,
was killed. The friars of this same order (Franciscan), fearing
trouble, sent out a relief party under Friar Beltran and with
this went Antonio de Espejo, a daring and wealthy citizen of
Mexico. The departure was made November 10, 1582, the
route leading northward to the Rio Grande and the country
they called New Mexico. Following up the river, which they
spoke of as the Rio del Norte, passing after a while through a
number of permanent villages, "very well built," with estufas
(kivas) in most of them, and seeing others at a distance, they
arrived at the Tiguex group. In one of these called Poala,
the friars had been killed. It will be noticed that there were a
number of villages below Tiguex. These were probably the
Tutahaco of Coronado's journey. Six leagues up the river
from Tiguex they found a province called Quires, and fourteen
leagues farther, on a small tributary (the Puerco) they came
to Cunames. Then another five or six leagues north-west
were seven villages of the Ameies people; and about fifteen
leagues west of this was the pueblo of Acoma. Thus it is
perfectly clear that Espejo travelled from Tiguex <i>continually
northward and north-westward</i> to reach Acoma. If we start
assuming Bernalillo to be Tiguex<a name='FA_43' id='FA_43' href='#FN_43' class='fnanchor'>[43]</a> it throws Acoma in the
latitude of Taos which of course is out of the question. Yet
the scholars of to-day persist is locating Tiguex at Bernalillo,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
many miles out of Espejo's inward route. For the locations
of these villages see <a href="#i-144">map on page 115</a>.

<p>
From Acoma he went on west to Zuñi, probably the first
white man ever to set foot there, and he found at that place
three of the Mexican natives who had remained in the country
as noted above. This fact has been made much of, too much,
in establishing Zuñi as the site of Cibola, even to the extent
of nullifying the testimony from Espejo's route and other
equally valuable data.<a name='FA_44' id='FA_44' href='#FN_44' class='fnanchor'>[44]</a> A considerable number of these
Mexicans had stopped at Tiguex and other places, and it is not
to be supposed that they were petrified in their tracks. Espejo
continued westward from Zuñi, about to the San Francisco
Mountains, but he did not see the great Colorado. Returning
to Zuñi he struck out for the upper waters of the Rio Grande,
reaching it sixty leagues above his Quires villages. Returning
to the latter, he took an easterly course to Hubates, then
north to the Tamos, and east again to the Pecos River which
he followed out of the country, naming it the Rio de las Vacas,
because of the large herds of buffalo he saw.<a name='FA_45' id='FA_45' href='#FN_45' class='fnanchor'>[45]</a>
</p>

<p>
Still nothing had been done in the way of permanent settlements.
But this was now to come. Fifteen years later, in
1598, the famous expedition of the bold and wealthy Juan
de Oñate, who had been appointed governor, made its way
up the Rio Grande, a long and elaborate train. Travelling
through many villages he finally established the settlement of
San Gabriel, at the native village called San Juan, north of the
present Santa Fé. Next to St. Augustine (1565), this, now
marked by the village of Chamita, is the oldest European town
within the limits of the United States. Six years later, with
thirty soldiers and two padres, he crossed New Mexico and
Arizona, by way of Zuñi; the Moki towns; a stream he called
Colorado, now the Little Colorado; skirting the San Francisco
mountains; to the great Colorado at the mouth of Bill
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
Williams Fork. He called the Colorado the Rio Grande de
Esperanza, and descended to its mouth, where he stood January
28, 1605, three full centuries ago.
</p>

<p>
The same year, on his return, he founded Santa Fé, later
went out across the plains toward the Missouri, and was generally
active and efficient. Every effort was made to organise
the country, and though the padres worked earnestly and fearlessly,
there was much dissatisfaction, which had begun with
the treatment the Puebloans received from the captains of
Coronado's expedition. The latent fires smouldered. A
native of Taos began to organise an opposition, and in 1680
he had united about all the Puebloans, who, on signal, began
a war of extermination. The Spaniards were speedily overwhelmed
and driven from the country. Had the Puebloans
been able to continue their league the re-occupation of New
Mexico would have been long delayed, but they were not accustomed
to fighting in concert, hence when General Vargas
appeared with a conquering force in 1692 the rebellion collapsed
like a house of cards. It was their last stand.
</p>

<p>
Although Spain laid numberless restrictions on exploration
and settlement in the endeavour to compel large tribute to the
royal coffers, the opening of the next century saw a number
of settlements flourishing in New Mexico. Missions were
established with greater permanence, the ruins of the old ones
bestowing an air of long European occupation on the new land.
Villages were settled by Spaniards and their families, cattle,
and sheep were brought in larger numbers, and agriculture
was developed on a greater scale, so that at last the life of
Europe became rooted in this foreign soil. Each governor
during his term ruled much at his own pleasure, being so far
from the central power, and they went usually on the principle
of making hay while the sun shines. The regions away from
the Rio Grande were left alone as a rule, though expeditions
from time to time went on various errands: to punish the
Apaches or other predatory tribes; or, perhaps, to oppose the
progress of the French from the eastward. About 1720, one
under Villazur, Governor Cossio's lieutenant, was sent out on
the plains to the Pawnee villages, for what purpose is not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
exactly clear, but it seems to have been with an idea of enlisting
this tribe against the French. Almost the entire force
was massacred, only a few escaping to carry the news to Santa
Fé. The Spaniards blamed the French for inciting the natives
to this act, and as such action was quite common always by
French, Spaniards, and English alike, it is not improbable.
</p>

<p>
By this time a number of Spanish settlements were established
in Texas and there was intermittent communication.

<p>
The year Coronado returned Cabrillo coasted north on the
Pacific, touching here and there along what is now California,
and died at the Santa Barbara Islands, the command then falling
to Ferrelo, who explored as far as what is now the southern
line of Oregon. The famous English pirate, Drake, thirty-seven
years later, with his vessel filled with Spanish plunder,
sailed north from the west coast of Mexico endeavouring to
find a water passage to the Atlantic. He repaired his ship in
a bay, and to-day, just north of the Golden Gate, a small bay
is known as Drake's Bay. Another thirteen years and a
Greek, Juan de Fuca, discovered the strait which is now known
by his name, as well as the great arm of the sea called Puget's
Sound. Four years after this Vizcaino was sent with three
vessels to explore the northern coast, but he did not then go
beyond the Gulf of California.<a name='FA_46' id='FA_46' href='#FN_46' class='fnanchor'>[46]</a>
</p>

<p>
Then Philip III. came to the throne and adopted more
vigorous measures than his predecessor. Vizcaino was again
sent forth, in 1602, with a command to make a close examination
of the coast, and this expedition had fruitful results in
breaking the Wilderness in that direction. Vizcaino entered
the harbour of San Diego, which had earlier been visited by
Cabrillo. Here he heard accounts of the New Mexican settlements
from the natives. Then he sailed past the Santa Barbara
Islands, turned Cape Concepcion, which he named, and
made a general examination, covering the same course as
Cabrillo, which convinced him that the land was fertile and
a good place for colonies. He finally obtained permission
to organise and settle the region, but died before he could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
execute his plans. Many years then rolled away with no attempt
to open the rich Californian lands. It was not till 1697 that
any settlement was made, and this was in Lower California, on
the east side, and was called Loreto, the beginning of Friar
Salvatierra's Jesuit missions, in which enterprises he was assisted
by friars Kino, Piccolo, Ugarte, and others, who, with
great labour, extending over a period of sixty years, founded
and maintained sixteen missionary settlements, all on the east
side of the peninsula and none in Upper or Alta California.
Kino had established in Sonora, in 1687, the mission of Dolores,
and from this place he passed back and forth to the
missions of Lower California, learning the topography of the
region around the mouth of the Colorado and making, in 1701,
a fairly accurate map of the head of the Gulf. He was the first
white man to see the now famous Pima ruins, called Casa
Grande, a huge adobe mass of thick walls built in prehistoric
times.

<p>
The Jesuit order was at length superseded, 1767, by the
Franciscan, whose members, patient, earnest workers in their
cause, at once began efforts to plant missions in Alta California,
and in the spring of 1769 they proceeded from La Paz, on the
west shore of the Gulf of California, with cattle, sheep, and
horses to San Diego, sending ships around with supplies.
They arrived on May 14th and found two vessels already in
the harbour, so that the settlement was immediately begun.
It was the first in this portion of the Wilderness. A second
party was to establish itself at the Bay of Monterey, but missing
the way came to San Francisco Bay instead, then returned
to Monterey, and finally to San Diego. The natives were
hostile, food grew scarce, and starvation threatened, but a
vessel, which had been sent back for supplies, came in the
nick of time. The prosperity of California began with this
event, March 10, 1770. Other settlers followed, cattle multiplied,
vines and fruit trees bore abundantly, till, before the
eventful year of 1776, the California missions were forever out
of reach of the bony grasp of starvation. By the close of the
decade eight had been founded from San Diego to San Francisco,
and before the end of the century nine more.<a name='FA_47' id='FA_47' href='#FN_47' class='fnanchor'>[47]</a> Each
consisted of a church, storehouses, workshops, dwellings, and
a fort, usually arranged in a square. All these structures were
at first extremely simple, but as time passed the friars exhibited
their artistic taste in the construction of really admirable
specimens of architecture. Some of these are still standing
and will bear out this assertion. There were in California four
presidios, or military posts, in addition to the forces at the
missions, at San Diego, Monterey, Santa Barbara, and San
Francisco.

<p>
The missions of the Rio Grande and those of California
possessed no route for overland communication. Two monks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
of the Franciscan order, in trying to establish such a route,
established for themselves imperishable fame. They were
Garces and Escalante. Not far from where Tucson now
stands a mission had been founded by Kino, whom Humboldt
calls the "astronomer of Ingolstadt." This was San Xavier
del Bac. Franciscans were occupying the place, and there
Garces made headquarters, accomplishing five journeys from
that point. The presidio, or military post, of Tubac was about
thirty miles south of Bac, and from that post soldiers kept
watch on the natives of the region. Garces reached Bac in
June, 1768, and made two preliminary explorations before the
end of 1770. In 1771 he reached the Colorado over the same
trail that Kino had followed long before, but the Franciscans
seemed to have no record of this nor of Oñate's trail; at least
they did not profit by these earlier explorations. In 1774,
with Captain Anza, Garces made the trip across the Colorado
through to the mission of San Gabriel, near the site of the
present town of Los Angeles.
</p>

<p>
In the winter of 1775-76 Garces again went with Anza,
who was bound for San Francisco Bay, there to found a mission,
to the Colorado, where he stopped for a time, then went
on to San Gabriel. Returning to the Mohave country he
struck eastward, June 4, 1776, on his celebrated entrada,<a name='FA_48' id='FA_48' href='#FN_48' class='fnanchor'>[48]</a> with
no companions but the natives along the route, and on July 2d
reached Oraibi, only to be there treated with supreme contempt.
On the 4th he was driven from the town, and he returned
to the mission of Bac by way of the Colorado River.
</p>

<p>
Escalante was at this moment making preparations for his
traverse to the San Gabriel Mission. On July 29th he started
<i>north</i>, absurd as it may now appear to us who know the whole
geography. Crossing western Colorado, over Green River,
which he called Buenaventura, near the mouth of White
River, he mounted the Wasatch Range by the Uinta and its
branches, and entered Salt Lake valley, probably by what is
now known as Spanish Fork. After viewing Lake Timpanogos
(Utah Lake), he turned southward, followed down the
western edge of the great mountains extending north and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
south along the central line of Utah, about through where
Fillmore, Beaver, and Parowan now stand, to the Virgen
River at about Toquerville. Here the season indicating the
approach of winter, it was decided to abandon the attempt to
reach San Gabriel, and strike eastward for the Moki Towns,
where Escalante previously had been. He was not aware of
the tremendous obstacles, in the nature of deep canyons,
which intervened. After a vast amount of effort he crossed,
not the Grand Canyon, as has sometimes been stated, but the
lower end of Glen Canyon, at a point about thirty-five miles
above what is now Lee Ferry. The place is still known as the
Crossing of the Fathers. From here there was a trail to the
Moki Towns, and their anxiety soon came to an end.
</p>

<p>
The route Garces travelled from the west to the Moki
Towns became no highway; indeed, for years was not travelled
at all, nor had Escalante's anything in its favour so far as
reaching California was concerned. For half a century longer
the New Mexican and Californian missions remained about as
far apart as ever. Those in California waxed rich and had
little cause to desire the world to come to them. When it
did come it was the beginning of their end.
</p>

<p>
The Spaniards were as brave a people as ever lived. They
had now firmly established themselves in Texas, in New Mexico,
and in California, and their claims on the basis of first
exploration covered a vast area. In every direction they opposed
the entrance of other nationalities. The lands were
forced to pay tribute to Spain; nothing was left for local
government, and these methods, the antithesis of home rule,
were the undoing of this noble race.

While Coronado was striving from the direction of
Mexico to reach the mirage-like cities of Quivira,
which the deceitful Turk asserted were somewhere eastward
of the Rio Grande, and in search of which he arrived in some
locality not many miles from the present site of Kansas City,<a name='FA_49' id='FA_49' href='#FN_49' class='fnanchor'>[49]</a>
another Spaniard, whose name is better known, not for greater
deeds, but because the country he traversed is more familiar,
and because of his romantic burial at night beneath the turbid
flood he had been second to discover, was marching and
fighting towards the great river so permanently linked with
his name. This was Hernando de Soto, who, in 1539, had
landed with a large force at Tampa Bay for the purpose
of conquering and appropriating to his heart's desire all of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
Florida, a realm comprising then the whole continent east of
the River of Palms, now the Rio Grande. His cruelties to
the natives were frightful, and as he wandered he left a trail
of mingled Spanish and native blood, which at length led him,
in 1541, to the Mississippi, where he crossed some distance
above the mouth of the Arkansas. Near Tampa he had captured
a white man, a survivor of the Narvaez party, who had
been preserved among the natives by the intercession of a
chief's daughter, and this Juan Ortiz should have been a reminder
of the fate of Narvaez, a fate largely due to imprudence,
bad management, and a disregard for the rights of
natives; but it seems to have conveyed no warning.
</p>

<p>
Continuing his harsh career into the Wilderness as far as
what is now central Arkansas, he turned south and passed the
winter of 1541-42 in north-western Louisiana, or south-western
Arkansas. Coronado spent this same winter at Tiguex, on
the Rio Grande, where the inhabitants declared the Spaniards
had no regard for friendship or their pledged word. In the
spring Soto went down to the mouth of Red River. There
his health failed. He died, and his followers, to prevent the
natives from finding his grave, buried him in the deep water
of the river. The command fell to Moscoso de Alvarado,
who now led the company again westward, hoping to come to
Spanish settlements, but when he arrived in Texas at the
upper part of Trinity River he abandoned the attempt and
returned to the Mississippi.
</p>

<p>
He had probably been within less than two hundred miles
of the place where Coronado, about the same time, sent his
army back. They had rumours of the presence of Coronado,
but the nature of the country was so forbidding they feared
to proceed. Moscoso was even more brutal than Soto. He
punished natives by cutting off their noses and their right
hands; or, by another method not unusual with the early
Spaniards, setting hungry dogs on a victim to tear him to
pieces before their eyes. At last this remnant of the expedition,
that had started with high hopes, succeeded in building
boats with which they descended the Mississippi and coasted
westward, reaching the province of Panuco, in north-eastern
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
Mexico. A great deal of misery and death had been brought
to the people of the new land, but, aside from ground for an
additional Spanish claim, little more had been accomplished
by this than by the Narvaez expedition.

Although the Spaniards opposed vigorously the coming to
the New World of any other people, New Spain soon found a
rival in New France, and then in New England. Cortez had
barely finished the overthrow of the Aztecs before Verrazano,
for the French King, cruised along the Atlantic coast from
Hatteras northward to where French fishermen already had
been, and where Cartier in 1534, ten years later, discovered
the great island we call Newfoundland and his Gulf of St.
Lawrence. The next year he sailed up the great river, to
which he gave the same name, and thereby opened the real
gate to our Wilderness; for it was by this route, and not by
the south, that the best early entrance was offered, on account
of the numerous closely connected lakes and waterways of
various kinds. Travel in a new country is always easier by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
boat than by any other method, for, if there are plenty of
waterways, a canoe and its cargo can be carried from the head
of one stream, or lake, to the next nearest one, and so a practically
continuous passage effected with quantities of goods,
which otherwise could not be transported without a large
number of pack-animals or waggons, and pack-animals frequently
need a way cleared for them, while a waggon in a new
land is often impossible. So by these waterways, numerously
ramifying from the mouth of the St. Lawrence into the vast
western Unknown, the Frenchmen, with the beautiful birch-bark
canoe of the Amerind, whose skill they also speedily
acquired, entered the Wilderness with a sailor's light-heartedness,
singing their gay chansons as they paddled along; songs
with little sense but much rhythm, like all the ditties sailors
use for expediting their labours, which, like rowing or paddling,
require to be accomplished in unison. As New France developed
into Canada the <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageur</span></i> became a familiar and distinct
character; a creation of the New World. He was as
competent with a canoe as was his Spanish brother, the
<i><span lang="es_ES">vaquero</span></i>, with the horse. We meet him constantly in the
Wilderness, and all the waterways leading to it, his airy verses
echoing through the forest till the sombre pine trees seemed
more lightly to wave their drooping branches; or dying across
limitless stretches of prairie, in conflict, perhaps, with the
stranger notes of some Amerindian chant.
</p>

<p>
By these songs the <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i> united the strokes of their
oars or paddles, and they were often responsive, like the sailor-songs
on shipboard, between one party and the other; the
steersman and the rowers, or the forward and the stern oarsmen.
One stanza of a <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageur's</span></i> song will serve to give their
character:

Cartier opened the way as far as Hochelaga, now the site
of Montreal, which was soon to become the very centre of all
commerce with the Wilderness. Attempts were made by the
French to found settlements down the coast, and one, on St.
John's River, in Florida, seemed to have some life in it till the
Spaniards entrenched themselves at St. Augustine, and from
there crushed the French fort and the French power in that
quarter for all time. This St. Augustine of the Spaniards was
the first permanent settlement of Europeans within the limits
of the United States (1565), antedating by forty years Oñate's
founding of his first village at San Juan, New Mexico, now
marked, as previously mentioned, by the little town of
Chamita.
</p>

<p>
About the time that Oñate was organising New Mexico
there came over to the north-east coast one Sieur de Monts,
who established Port Royal for France in a region named
Acadia, lying between the Lower St. Lawrence and the Atlantic,
a title later restricted to the portion now called Nova
Scotia, and immortalised in Longfellow's poem, <i>Evangeline</i>.
But it was not till the illustrious Champlain, afterwards so
justly famous, founded Quebec, in 1608, that France really
closed her grip on the north-eastern part of the continent; a
grip that was later to be broken for ever by the British. Having
permanently settled Quebec, Champlain, with his <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i>,
extended his travels westward by watercourses and lakes as far
as the Straits of Mackinaw, founding many trading-posts and
missions, and marking the first practicable highway to the
Wilderness. He was efficiently supported in his efforts by
monks of the Jesuit and Franciscan orders, brethren of those
who were labouring diligently in the south-west, and who,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
though their energetic and sincere labours to Christianise the
natives amounted to no more than a puff-ball tossed against
the side of a battleship, performed a great and indispensable
work in this breaking of the Wilderness.

The British also began to turn their attention to the New
World, and after several explorations along the coast—Raleigh's
attempt at settlement in what is now North Carolina;
Davis's exploration in the Far North, where his name
still remains to designate the strait he discovered—they finally
founded on James River their first permanent settlement in
1607, two years after the establishment of Santa Fé, New
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
Mexico. To this they gave the name Jamestown, and from it
as a centre they expanded their power. The French were
pushing out at the North; the Spaniards controlled the South
and West. Then a fourth nation appeared—the Dutch—who
settled at what is now New York in 1614, five years after
Hudson discovered the river now bearing his name to mark
the event. Not long after this Hudson found for England
the immense bay to which his name was given, and where
his mutinous crew turned him, with some of his adherents,
adrift on the icy sea. Never was he heard from again.
Then the <i>Mayflower</i> came, freighted heavily with new and
forceful ideas and a hardy company, who entered by Plymouth
Rock; so that by 1625 all the forces that were to
battle for the mastery of North America had established their
footings, and with the various native tribes, who opposed
their encroachment and their cruelty, they soon turned the
land into a pandemonium. Almost daily the natives were
given exhibitions of treachery, brutality, butchery, on the part
of these newcomers among themselves, even while the good
priests held aloft the crucifix and repeated, "Thou shalt not!"
Is it a wonder the Amerind refused to believe? He was quick
to perceive that, except the priests, the one sole object of all
these warring people was pecuniary advantage. This, indeed,
was rendered imperative by the European system of life.
</p>

<p>
As a rule the French were the most humane, the most just;
they treated the natives more as if they might be human
beings with sensitiveness and intelligence. William Penn, and
his followers among the English, and the Hudson Bay Company,
also dealt justly with them, but in the eyes of the others
the Amerind was a beast of the forest to be exterminated.
The French sent their missionaries and traders far to the West
and before long had acquired a hold on the continent equal to
that of the Spaniards; a hold which it then seemed impossible
should ever be lessened. Raddison, the French trader, is said
to have been on the head of the Mississippi as early as 1660.
</p>

<p>
Marquette and Joliet, the former a priest, the latter a
trader, were sent by Frontenac, in 1673, to search for a route
across the Wilderness to the Pacific by way of a great river, of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
which much was told by the natives. The river indicated was
doubtless the Columbia. Proceeding from Michigan they
finally came at the mouth of the Wisconsin to the river forming
the eastern boundary of the vaster Wilderness, the Mississippi,
called by Marquette Conception, and down it they went,
instead of up, as they should have gone to get on the track to
the Pacific, their birch-bark canoes gliding swiftly along, while
the unfathomed waters for the first time heard the song of the
<i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageur</span></i>. Down they went to Soto's burial-place. They were
encroaching on the claims of the Spaniards, but boundaries
then were as nebulous as the Milky Way, and the sword was
the instrument of survey by which all lines were drawn. Their
flag was finally carried through to the mouth of the Mississippi
by that splendid character Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle,<a name='FA_51' id='FA_51' href='#FN_51' class='fnanchor'>[51]</a>
a Frenchman whose qualities shine ever undimmed by the roll
of fading centuries. With Tonty and Hennepin he came
through the Great Lakes, and, leaving these two men behind,
reached with his party the Mississippi at the mouth of the
Illinois, and proceeding down it finally, in 1682, standing at
the delta beside a great claim-post, he proclaimed the jurisdiction
of Louis the Great (XIV.) over all this country of
"Louisiana,"
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"the seas, harbours, ports, bays, adjacent straits, and all nations,
peoples, provinces, cities, towns, villages, mines, minerals, fisheries,
streams, and rivers, within the extent of said Louisiana, from the
mouth of the great river St. Louis, otherwise called the Ohio, ...
as also along the river Colbert or Mississippi, and the rivers which
discharge themselves thereinto, from its source beyond the country
of the Nadouessioux ... as far as the mouth of the sea, or
Gulf of Mexico, and also to the mouth of the river of Palms, upon
the assurance we have from the natives of these countries, that we
are the first Europeans who have descended or ascended the said
river Colbert."
</p>

They had forgotten Pineda and the unfortunate Soto and Moscoso,
to say nothing of the still more unfortunate Narvaez,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
who was wrecked at the river's entrance. This claim certainly
was broad; it covered almost everything.
</p>

<p>
La Salle had a magnificent dream of developing this enormous
region for his King, and proceeding to France he came
back with vessels laden with supplies and colonists. But they
missed the mouth of the river. Then a series of disasters left
the leader stranded, as the Narvaez survivors had been, on the
coast of Texas. La Salle, of all men, surely deserved more
generous treatment from Fortune. But worse was to follow.
They struck out for the north-east to reach the French settlements.
La Salle was ambushed and shot March 18, 1687, by
a villainous member of the company, leagued with other assassins,
and his body stripped and thrown to the wolves. But
La Salle needed no gorgeous funeral train, no costly sepulchre
to carry through the ages to come his illustrious
name.
</p>

<p>
One of the assassin band, he who served as a decoy, was a
youth of sixteen named l'Archeveque, who later arrived in
New Mexico, lived a highly respected life there, and was
eventually killed at the Pawnee village with Villazur.<a name='FA_52' id='FA_52' href='#FN_52' class='fnanchor'>[52]</a> L'Archeveque,
with four others from the dismembered La Salle
expedition, three young men and a girl, were found among
the Tejas, two years after La Salle's murder, by Alonzo de
Leon, a Spaniard who came up into Texas from Coahuila, one
of the northern provinces of Mexico. He ransomed all and
sent them to Mexico. Three years later, 1692, the Spaniards
organised a settlement at San Antonio, and henceforth the
French and Spaniards began in a hostile way to encounter
each other on these wide frontiers. Iberville, in 1699, started
near the mouth of the Mississippi the first permanent French
settlement, and the French then rapidly spread along that
river and its branches, and when the eighteenth century was
fairly under way they had explored the country immediately
along the Mississippi and the regions between it and Montreal;
they had pushed far out into the North-west, even to the
banks of the Saskatchewan. Indeed, a Frenchman is said to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
have reached Hudson Bay in 1656. All through these regions
were beaver, bison, deer, panthers, and numerous other fur-bearing
animals. The trapping of these and trading for them
with the natives formed the chief incentive of the Frenchmen,
just as the search for imaginary mines and fabulous cities
actuated the Spaniards. The pursuit of the fur business
offered a life of wild freedom, particularly fascinating to many
Frenchmen, who fraternised with the natives and were able
peacefully to travel from tribe to tribe, exchanging European
wares for furs and other property the Amerinds had. The
Amerinds welcomed these pedlars, for they wanted the goods
they brought; and numbers of them ranged the forests, finally
being collectively called <i><span lang="fr_FR">Coureurs de Bois</span></i>. They have been
described as a kind of outlaw, but they were not exactly that.
Their lives, knowing no restriction but their own consciences,
highly elastic like almost all the consciences of that time, and
perhaps this, were not always models of propriety, but they
were in general probably little worse than the throat-cutting
gentlemen who composed a large part of the several samples
of the European nations which were striving to murder each
other, and incidentally the natives, for the purpose of acquiring
sole possession of everything in sight. In the perusal of
the history of the development of this continent it seems
almost ludicrous to describe the natives particularly as the
savages. One could fill a library with volumes detailing the
murderous brutality of the white race, not only in dealing with
the natives, but with each other. The native was hardly more
than a good second in rapine and butchery, even when he was
employed by one side or the other to raise slaughter to a fine
art.

In 1669 the British formed a settlement in the shape of a
fur-trading post on the coast of Hudson Bay. This was the
first of a series of establishments founded by "The Governor
and Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudson's
Bay," a company which, because of its masterly control,
wise management, general fairness to the natives, and complete
efficiency, was highly successful and of wide and long-continued
influence.

As the eighteenth century opened, the French seemed to
be in the lead. They claimed and controlled Canada and the
greater part of the Mississippi valley, and by 1710 there were
many French colonies and posts on the banks of the Mississippi.
Eight years later Bienville founded New Orleans, and
two after that Antoine Crozat received from the King a
grant of the privilege of exclusive trade in Louisiana, a privilege
which he relinquished in 1717, when it was taken by the
Compagnie d'Orient, or, as it also was called, Law's Mississippi
Company. It was so held for fifteen years, when it was governed
as a French province. By 1722 the French had established
a fort on the Missouri called Orleans, about two hundred
and fifty miles above the mouth, by some authorities said to
have been the result of the Spanish expedition under Villazur,
which was destroyed, according to some reports, in an attempt
to annihilate the Missouris, who were friendly to the French.
But the Spaniards claimed that the French instigated the attack
upon their 1720 expedition to the Platte; and the French,
it appears, claimed that the Spanish were striving to wipe out
their allies.
</p>

<p>
There were now open into the interior two great water
highways, one by the St. Lawrence, the other by the Mississippi-Missouri.
Transportation was almost exclusively by
boat, hence the waterways were seldom departed from for any
great distance, and the immense tract lying west of the Missouri
and upper Mississippi was still an unknown country.
From time to time rumours were repeated of a huge river
which flowed towards the Sea of the West, but the traders did
not always heed the tales of the natives. As early as 1716
there was a definite statement that "towards the source (of
the Mississippi) there is in the highlands a river that leads to
the western ocean." Whether some Frenchman had made the
journey or not is unknown, but it is not improbable that a
daring <i><span lang="fr_FR">coureur de bois</span></i> had slipped along from tribe to tribe
and finally arrived at the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
In 1728 there was a trader at Lake Nipigon—Sieur de
la Verendrye, a Frenchman, to whom the natives told such
positive tales about this great river flowing to the Sea of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
West, that he determined to explore it.<a name='FA_53' id='FA_53' href='#FN_53' class='fnanchor'>[53]</a> He laid his plans
before Beauharnois, then Governor of Canada, who was favourably
impressed by the story, and also by a map which Verendrye's
Amerind guide had drawn for him. An expedition of
fifty men was fitted out, which left Montreal in 1731 under the
command of Verendrye's sons and nephew. The party seem
not to have moved directly for the river they intended to
examine, but spent a number of years exploring, trading, and
trapping in the North-west country. Finally, in 1738, they
built an advance post, Fort La Reine, on the Assiniboine,
whence they continued explorations north and south. In the
latter direction they ascended the Souris, or Mouse, River,
and at length arrived in the country of the Mandans, on the
Missouri, at the great bend to the south, in what is now North
Dakota, antedating in the region Lewis and Clark by over
threescore years. This was in 1738. Again in 1742 the
company arrived at the Missouri under the command of the
eldest son and his brother, passed the Yellowstone River, and
on January 1, 1743, came in sight of the Rocky Mountains,
perhaps the Big Horn range, probably the first white men to
see them from this direction; that is, north of about the 38th
parallel, where the Spaniards had been. They climbed these
mountains, and appear to have proceeded westward, perhaps
as far as Wind River, where they remained some time in the
country of the Snakes, hearing of another river farther south
called Karoskiou, probably the head of the Colorado, now
named Green River. They were then within about two hundred
miles of the point reached, twenty-three years later,
by Escalante, and not much farther from the locality on
Grand River arrived at in 1765 by Don Juan Maria de
Ribera.
</p>

<p>
Owing to a war between the Snakes and a tribe to the
southward named Arcs, they were unable to go on and returned
to the upper Missouri in May, 1743, somewhere erecting
a stone monument to commemorate their entrance into the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
region. Having done this they went to the Saskatchewan
valley by way of their Fort La Reine. Jealousy of their success
and changes in the governorship of Canada resulted in the overthrow
of the Verendryes, but Jonquire later, coming to the
head of the government, determined to profit by their investigations
and planned two expeditions to the Pacific, one over
the course Verendrye had pursued, and the other by the
waters of the Saskatchewan. These appear to have had little
success, yet some of the men reached the Rocky Mountains,
and were there in 1753. The war with England then prevented
further organised explorations by the French. Several
accounts of the existence of a large river beginning at the head
of the Missouri and flowing west to the Pacific had been given
by the Amerinds, as already noted, Dupratz having heard one
from a native of the Yazoo country.<a name='FA_54' id='FA_54' href='#FN_54' class='fnanchor'>[54]</a> This man said he had
himself ascended the Missouri to its source and there found
this other river, which he followed for some distance, wars preventing
him from going through to the ocean into which he
was told it entered. Several maps of about 1750 gave a supposed
course of this river, which was called the Great River
of the West. Jonathan Carver<a name='FA_55' id='FA_55' href='#FN_55' class='fnanchor'>[55]</a> also told of this stream, called
the Oregon, in his book describing the travels he made in
1766-68 into the region of the upper Mississippi; but he did
not go there.<a name='FA_56' id='FA_56' href='#FN_56' class='fnanchor'>[56]</a> The Dane, Bering, under Russian patronage,
in 1741, had marked out a path to the New World from a
totally different direction from any taken by the other nations;
he came from the West, from Kamtchatka, by the far northern
route. The Russians followed and began to explore down the
North-west coast.

Having triumphed over France, Great Britain in 1763 acquired
the whole of Canada, all of Louisiana east of the Mississippi
except New Orleans, and the Spanish claims in Florida.
They now controlled the entire continent east of the Mississippi,
the Dutch having long before surrendered. France
published the next year a secret cession two years before of all
Louisiana west of the Mississippi to Spain, and Spain obtaining
New Orleans also in 1769, France was thrown completely
off the continent. In 1764, at the time France announced the
cession to Spain, La Clede founded St. Louis on the site where
it now stands, a settlement that henceforth became the departing
point for the great Wilderness. Great Britain renounced
all claim to lands south-west of the Mississippi, and the vast
territory of North America was now divided between Great
Britain, Spain, and Russia, the latter on the north-west, Spain
on the south-west, and Great Britain on the east. Spain was
endeavouring to clinch its hold on the Californian coast and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
the regions to northward, and several vessels were sent out in
that direction. One of these, commanded by Bruno Heceta,
returning from more northern shores on the evening of August
17, 1775, came to a great bay where a current was discovered
setting out from the land with such power that Heceta thought
he had found either some great river or some connection with
another sea. The Strait of Fuca was then supposed to join
the Atlantic, under the old title of the fabled Strait of Anian,
and he also thought he might be at the mouth of this, although
his reckoning did not agree with that of Fuca. In reality he
had discovered thus vaguely the mouth of the River of the
West, now the Columbia. He called the place the Bahia de la
Asuncion, but later charts mark it the Inlet of Heceta, while
the supposed river is put down as Rio de San Roque. Aguilar,
who commanded one of Vizcaino's ships in 1603, went north
of Cape Mendocino to the mouth of a great river, which he
could not enter on account of the current. This was probably
the Columbia. Thus from sea and land the existence of a large
river in this quarter began to be understood. Owing to the
line of fierce white-caps formed by the tides breaking on the
great bar, extending across the mouth of this river, even now,
as one views the entrance from the deck of his approaching
ship, after government execution of a large amount of admirable
engineering, it presents a most impracticable looking
channel, the white foam appearing to form a continuous line.
At low water, with a sea running, the place is still one of difficult
passage, and reminds of Gray, the bold sailor who first
steered through it. Heceta, however, did not hesitate from
timidity, he was a Spaniard, but his officers dissuaded him
from making an attempt to enter on account of their unfit
condition.
</p>

<p>
Once across the bar, the broad bay and river-mouth offer
easy navigation, and it is a beautiful voyage, though a short
one, up to the site of the fine, prosperous American city which
now stands at this gateway, where the Far West opens into
the Far East.
</p>

<p>
As the last quarter of the eighteenth century fairly developed,
an event took place which perhaps, influenced the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
destinies of man more than any other of modern times. Garces
and Escalante had barely completed their entradas before the
guns of the American Revolution had for ever shattered the
fetters of a new people on the Atlantic seaboard, where a
youthful giant sprang into being, a portent for Spain of great
danger. The Spaniards posted their sentinels facing that way.

</p>

<p>
Spain had good reason to turn a watchful eye on the
people of the Atlantic seaboard. No sooner was the war
for independence triumphantly concluded than they began
to look intently toward the vast Wilderness that made up
the bulk of the continent, a region so little understood,
and the object of so many uncertain, conflicting, and ill-founded
claims. Russia was beginning to assert claims from
the north-west, Spain had acquired the rights and claims of
France, and, with her own, wanted everything west of the
Mississippi, while Great Britain advanced from the north-east.
The middle road was open to the Americans. The new nation
managed its affairs with great skill. Though Spain and France
combined to obstruct the westward movement of the young
country, and particularly to prevent it from securing any territory
whatever near the mouth of the Mississippi, so as to
shut it off from free navigation, the treaty of 1783 gave the
United States all the country east of the great river and south
of the Great Lakes to the mouth of the Yazoo. Notwithstanding
opposition, the new Government positively held
a huge area, and was next-door neighbour to the delta of the
Mississippi as well as upon the threshold of the great undefined
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>145</a></span>
Wilderness, known as Louisiana, bordering the Father of Waters
on the west.
</p>

<p>
This immense extension of their domain gave a fresh impulse
to American exploration and settlement. They loved
the wild woods and came over the crest of the Alleghanies in
large numbers, erecting their log dwellings here, there, and
everywhere, till it was not long before the fertile region between
the Mississippi and the eastern mountains was filling
with settlements.

<p>
Many of these people were trappers and hunters. The fur
trade was yearly becoming a greater business; hundreds, despite
danger or privation, were eager to pursue wherever it
might lead. The pressure of civilised life with its rigid financial
demands was, and is, so intense that whenever a channel
of escape opens, the flow through it is as natural as that of
water through a puncture in the bottom of the kettle. There
were large profits to be made in furs, though it was usually the
organiser and business manager who reaped the full rewards.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
The Pacific coast offered in this line brilliant prospects, and
American vessels pushed around Cape Horn and sailed up the
western shores to secure a share of the trade of that region.
Spain, Great Britain, and Russia were also active there in the
fur business, as well as in that of "claiming." The Americans
then had no claims in that quarter.
</p>

<p>
The year following the agreement on the western boundary
of the United States, 1784, found a number of Montreal merchants
organising with the determination of participating in
the rich returns of the fur trade; a business where a penny
whistle was traded for a gold dollar. These men of Montreal
formed an association which they entitled the North-west
Company, consolidating with it a number of small rival concerns
which for some years had been operating separately, and
often disastrously, for they were frequently at war. The
North-west Company intended to occupy the country beyond
Lake Superior and oppose there the increasing power of the
Hudson Bay Company. One of the men taken into this partnership
was Alexander Mackenzie. He was the man for the
hour. He proceeded to the far shores of the Saskatchewan,
where posts had been established beyond those of the Verendryes
and earlier Frenchmen, whose former presence was now
marked only by the names they had applied to the natural
features of the country. But though the Verendryes were
forgotten, the <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageur</span></i> was still a chief factor in travel and in
trapping operations, and the <i><span lang="fr_FR">chansons</span></i> yet echoed through the
forests of that wild landscape, where, in the words of Butler,<a name='FA_57' id='FA_57' href='#FN_57' class='fnanchor'>[57]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"there are rivers whose single lengths roll through twice a thousand
miles of shoreland; prairies over which a rider can steer for months
without resting his gaze on aught save the dim verge of the ever-shifting
horizon; mountains rent by rivers, ice-topped, glacier
seared, impassable; forests whose sombre pines darken a region
half as large as Europe; sterile, treeless wilds, whose 400,000 square
miles lie spread in awful desolation.... In summer, a land of
sound, a land echoing with the voices of birds, the ripple of running
water, the mournful music of the waving pine branch; in winter,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
a land of silence, a land hushed to its inmost depths by the
weight of ice, the thick falling snow, the intense rigour of a merciless
cold."
</p>
</div>

<p>
This was the country the trapper first entered on his way
to the Wilderness we are specially considering; here where the
<i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageur</span></i> received some of the experience that made him so
valuable in this kind of work, the <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageur</span></i> whom Harmon
elaborately describes<a name='FA_58' id='FA_58' href='#FN_58' class='fnanchor'>[58]</a> as lively, fickle, cheerful in privation,
talkative, thoughtless, unrevengeful, not brave, deceitful,
smooth, polite, dishonest, unveracious, generous, ungrateful,
obedient, and unfaithful. Yet he was a man who served the
time admirably, who braved many dangers, whose labours
helped more than those of any other single element to open
the pathways of the Wilderness.
</p>

<p>
By 1778 the British had founded a trading-post within forty
miles of Lake Athabasca, and ten years after one on the shore
of Lake Athabasca itself. This was named Fort Chepewyan,
and historically is of great prominence, as it was the headquarters
of Alexander Mackenzie for eight years, and was his
starting-point on both the expeditions which are recorded
among the remarkable exploits of the modern world.<a name='FA_59' id='FA_59' href='#FN_59' class='fnanchor'>[59]</a> The
North-west Company was making systematic war upon the
Hudson Bay Company, and in order to gain advantage for his
association Mackenzie undertook the two expeditions, which
practically solved the geographical problems of the North-west
and determined the impossibility of the existence of any
north-west passage. In 1789 he descended, as far as its discharge
into the Arctic Ocean, the river that now bears his
name, but he was not the first to reach the Arctic overland,
for Samuel Hearne, of the Hudson Bay Company, eighteen
years before, had touched the shore some miles east of the
Mackenzie, having first discovered Great Slave Lake.
</p>

<p>
These journeys proved beyond question that the Straits of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
Anian, which had prominently figured on maps up to this time,
were a myth. Cook, who had been along the north-west coast,
had expressed strong doubts of the existence of any waterway
between the Atlantic and Pacific. Mackenzie's other journey
was of equal, if not greater, importance. It was in 1793 that
the start was made, and he followed up Peace River till, by
means of the chasm it cleaves in the great chain to free its
waters for their descent to the Mackenzie, he passed entirely
through the Rocky Mountains, and with admirable determination
and perseverance reached the shore of the Pacific just
north of Queen Charlotte Sound, completing the first traverse
on record of the North American continent above Mexico.
One river, that he followed down for some distance, which
was called by the natives Tacoutche Tesse, he thought was
the head of the Columbia, which had obtained this name the
year before. The Tacoutche Tesse, however, was not the
Columbia, as was some years later discovered, but the river
now called Fraser.
</p>

<p>
Navigators had been at work minutely examining the
Pacific coast of the Wilderness,—La Perouse, Dixon, Meares,
and others. Although Meares, for Great Britain, in 1788,
searched for the Rio de San Roque as laid down on Spanish
charts, according to Heceta's observations, and although he
actually entered the bay where it disembogues, he departed
without finding it, because the breakers were clearly seen by
him to extend entirely across the shore end of the inlet. In
consequence he applied to the place the title of Deception
Bay, and the prominent headland just north of it he called by
the name it still bears, Cape Disappointment. He declared
positively that there was no such river as the San Roque,
which illustrates the ease with which mistakes are made, even
by men of intelligence. It was a fortunate error for the
United States, as now neither the Spanish, who were still
clinging to the northern coasts, nor the British, who were
opposing them, had obtained any right of discovery in this
great river. No captain as yet had possessed the insight, or
the courage, or the resources, to dash through the formidable
line of fierce combers and open the mouth of the Columbia to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
the world. But its day was soon to arrive. The same year
that Meares in disappointment turned his prow away from the
entrance, an American merchant captain, Robert Gray, of
Boston, in his trading vessel, the <i>Washington</i>, had nearly
foundered in trying to force the passage. After this Gray exchanged
ships with Kendrick, a captain in the service of the
same company, and in the <i>Columbia</i> made a trip to China
and then home. Kendrick, meanwhile, with the <i>Washington</i>,
put into the Strait of Fuca and pretty well examined
this body of water, which Gray before him had entered to
the distance of fifty miles.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
After a while, 1792, Gray came back to the north-west coast
in the <i>Columbia</i> and met at the Strait of Fuca the great English
navigator Vancouver, who had been sent to make charts
of the coast, a work which he carried out so admirably that it
has been the basis for all charts ever since. Vancouver had
already been in Deception Bay before meeting Gray, so that
when the latter described the place he had tried to enter with
the <i>Washington</i>, and stated his belief in the existence of a
large river there, a belief perhaps increased by the statements
of Jonathan Carver, he refused to believe. Vancouver had
seen the breakers extending "two or three miles into the
ocean," and though he noticed that the sea there changed to
river water he thought it only from some minor stream, and did
not consider the subject of any importance. So, like Meares,
he had turned his back upon it, and now he went on to survey
Puget Sound. Gray, however, was of a different mind, and
he determined to return to the place to explore. It almost
seems, indeed, that Fate had appointed this discovery for
him. When he arrived there he did not hesitate, but prepared
his ship for the passage, and at eight <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> May 11, 1792, he
ran in "east-north-east between the breakers, having from five
to seven fathoms of water. When we were over the bar we
found this to be a large river of fresh water, up which we
steered." Thus, in spite of everything and with no effort or
desire to do it, the United States had acquired by right of discovery
a claim on this far-away country. The matter, which
at the time was little thought of, proved afterwards of considerable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
value. When Gray sailed out of the river, which he
was able to accomplish only after several attempts, he gave to
the river the name of his ship—Columbia. For some years the
name of Oregon, by which Carver had described it as he heard
the account from the natives, was also applied, as well as the
other title—River of the West,—but all at length gave way
before the name bestowed by the discoverer, whose action in
running the bar was all the more praiseworthy since other skilful
navigators had failed to fathom the secret of Deception Bay.
</p>

<p>
The following year Mackenzie arrived on the coast, just
after Vancouver had passed north in pursuing his excellent
survey. Thus little by little the white man was permanently
closing in on the great central Wilderness. In 1792-93 Todd,
a Scotchman with a special grant from Spain, made several
journeys from St. Louis up the Missouri, and Fidler, in the
employ of the North-west Company, travelled from Fort Buckingham
on the Saskatchewan south-west to the foot of the
Rocky Mountains and down through regions drained by the
Missouri. Dorion, afterwards with Lewis and Clark, had
lived with the Sioux since 1784 or earlier, and there were
many others like him.
</p>

<p>
Trading-posts were established here and there on the
Missouri; Pawnee House,<a name='FA_60' id='FA_60' href='#FN_60' class='fnanchor'>[60]</a> or Trudeau's House in 1796-97,
near the site of Fort Randall, was occupied by that trader,
and a year or two earlier Fort Charles was built six miles below
Omaha. Trappers and traders were constantly pushing out
into the Wilderness. St. Louis was developing from a mere
village to a town of importance, and some of the characters
intimately identified, a few years later, with the development
of the region were already there, notably the famous Manuel
Lisa, a Spaniard, shrewd, daring, and intelligent, speaking
with difficulty French and English, who made many enemies,
and who feared no man. His name is a part of the history of
the breaking of the Wilderness. As the eighteenth century
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
drew to a close this Wilderness had been completely circumnavigated.
Two and a half centuries had now gone by since
Coronado made his celebrated journey. Ships had passed
along the western confines; trappers had penetrated here and
there across the eastern part; Escalante had made his entrance
north almost to Salt Lake; yet the Wilderness remained the
Wilderness still.
</p>

<p>
Events were now to occur that would affect the Wilderness
more than anything which up to this time had taken place.
Spain in 1800 secretly transferred to France the great region
called Louisiana, the Spaniards to remain in possession till
such time as it pleased France to assume direction of the territory.
About two years passed before this transfer was published,
and meanwhile, though Napoleon had contemplated
putting a large army there, circumstances interfered. Having
had an agreement with the United States by which the latter
were permitted to use New Orleans as a port of deposit, Spain
reversed this, and the relations between these countries were
thenceforward not the pleasantest. Spain declined to renew
this privilege on the ground that the country belonged to
France and she had no right to do it. Thereupon the American
Government endeavoured to purchase the lands on the
east at the mouth of the river, West Florida and New Orleans,
and Napoleon, evidently discovering that he would be unable
to carry out his plans with regard to Louisiana, and notwithstanding
his solemn pledge to Spain that he would never part
with it, offered the whole to the United States. The offer
was accepted, and the sum of fifteen million dollars was finally
agreed upon as the purchase price. Communication was slow;
events were rapid; so that Lussat, who had been sent as
French Governor to New Orleans, to accept the territory from
Spain, received instructions that, instead of holding it, he was
to transfer it to the Americans. No one was more surprised
or chagrined than the French representative. Spain protested
that the transfer was not in conformity with the French agreement,
but it availed nothing, and the Spaniards at first were
inclined to refuse to give up the land. But on the 30th of
November, 1803, Louisiana was formally surrendered by Spain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
to France and twenty days later France gave possession to the
United States. Next to the Revolutionary War, the acquisition
of this vast region was the most important occurrence in
the life of the Americans. Yet it was a veritable "pig in a
poke" which they bought, for not only were its bounds undetermined,
except on the east, where it met the Republic, but
the character of the domain, for the most part, as is evident
from the preceding pages, was entirely unknown. Yet by this
purchase the mouth of the Mississippi was permanently secured
to the American people, and this was an object of paramount
importance; the nature of the Wilderness was secondary. On
the part of the Americans there had been a growing impulse
to investigate the great wild realm that so invitingly rolled away
from their very feet, and had the purchase not been consummated
it is probable they would nevertheless soon have passed
over into the forbidden land.<a name='FA_61' id='FA_61' href='#FN_61' class='fnanchor'>[61]</a> A vast amount of future difficulty
and war, for it takes as little to start a disastrous war
among the whites as ever it did among the Amerinds, was
permanently avoided.
</p>

<p>
The acquisition, indeed, was a boundless area. The very
first thing to be accomplished was to gain some knowledge of
its limits and possibilities. As for limits, it had, as noted, but
vague ones, yet on all maps showing the territory purchased
at this time the lines delimiting it, which were arrived at only
after years of diplomatic discussion, are presented as though
they had existence at the moment of purchase and had been
measured off like a town lot. As originally ceded by France
to Spain and again by Spain to France there were no defined
limits whatever other than the Mississippi River on the east,
though France claimed to the Rio Grande. The United
States acquired the same hazy demarkation. The map on
<a href="#i-183">page 154</a> shows in the dotted portion what the claims were at
the time of purchase, in 1803, as well as the defined boundaries
that eventually were established.

<p>
The Spanish claims ran up the western side of the continent
indefinitely, and thence eastward indefinitely. Great
Britain considered as belonging to her everything west, south,
and north of Winnipeg Lake indefinitely, and everything east,
north, and south from Nootka Sound indefinitely. Russia
thought that the continent from Bering Strait down to the
Columbia River and eastward indefinitely belonged to her,
while the United States on their part believed the Louisiana
they had taken off Napoleon's hands extended to the Rio
Grande on the south-west; and on the west and north-west, and
on the north as well, to an undefined distance. The task was
now to fit these indefinite bounds against each other, and it
was a task that consumed years of diplomacy. In pursuance
of this design, President Jefferson projected an expedition
which was to traverse the continent where no white men as yet
had penetrated—the region of the Columbia. It was destined
to take a first place among the explorations of the New World,
and to weld into one the names of two admirable men, and
this indelibly into the fabric of American history.
</p>

<p>
The Spanish sentinel had challenged, but the challenge was
unheeded. He was obliged to step back; and other backward
steps were in store for him.

<p>
The mighty Wilderness, which like a tennis-ball had been
tossed back and forth between the European kings, was
of particular interest to one of the foremost statesmen of the
new Republic, Thomas Jefferson, who pondered on its mysteries
and on ways of fathoming their fascinating depths. As
early as 1792 he had proposed to the American Philosophical
Society the raising of a subscription to send a small party to
the Pacific by way of the Missouri, across the "Stony Mountains"
and by the nearest river to the sea. A very young
man, Meriwether Lewis by name, eighteen at the time, asked
for the commission, but it was given to a French botanist,
Andre Michaux, who was also eager to see the Far West, and
who volunteered his services. The execution of the plan was
frustrated by the French Minister, who, as Michaux was in the
employ of the French Government, directed his path another
way.
</p>

<p>
When Jefferson was elected President of the United States,
in 1801, his mind, prepared therefore, turned more intently toward
the problematical region bordering the American domain
on the west. He now had for private secretary the same
Meriwether Lewis who had desired to search the Western wilds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
nine years earlier. Lewis had risen to captain<a name='FA_62' id='FA_62' href='#FN_62' class='fnanchor'>[62]</a> in the army
and had not lost interest in the exploration he had been unable
to undertake before, so when Jefferson in 1803 sent a confidential
message to Congress dealing with the subject of trading-posts
for the natives of the sparsely settled country and
beyond, and suggested an exploring expedition across the Wilderness,
Lewis knew all about it, and applied immediately for
the leadership. He was not yet twenty-nine, but his character
was well formed. Jefferson had learned it thoroughly in the
two years he had filled the position of secretary and says he
was
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"of courage undaunted; possessing a firmness and perseverance
of purpose which nothing but impossibilities could divert from its
direction; careful as a father of those committed to his charge, yet
steady in the maintenance of order and discipline; intimate with the
Indian character, customs, and principles; habituated to the hunting
life<a name='FA_63' id='FA_63' href='#FN_63' class='fnanchor'>[63]</a>; guarded, by exact observation of the vegetables and animals
of his own country, against losing time in the description of
objects already possessed; honest, disinterested, liberal, of sound
understanding, and a fidelity to truth so scrupulous, that whatever
he should report would be as certain as if seen by ourselves: with
all these qualifications, as if selected and implanted by nature in one
body for this express purpose, I could have no hesitation in confiding
the enterprise to him."
</p>
</div>

<p class="post">
Congress approving the plan, Lewis was appointed chief, and
no better man for the undertaking could have been found.<a name='FA_64' id='FA_64' href='#FN_64' class='fnanchor'>[64]</a>
</p>

<p>
Lewis selected as his first assistant, and to act as leader
in case of his own disability or death, William Clark, four
years his senior, and a brother of George Rogers Clark, who
had captured Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and the Illinois country,
and otherwise distinguished himself. Strangely enough, in
his mental and moral qualities William Clark was almost a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
duplicate of Meriwether Lewis. Throughout the whole of
the hazardous, difficult, toilsome journey that was now begun,
the two men were most devoted friends, Lewis having not the
slightest fear that Clark would receive too much credit, and
neither having the least jealousy of the other; quite in contrast
with some expeditions of later years, where the leader
must be all in all. The result was that the world to-day exalts
all the more this noble commander-in-chief because his broad
generosity forever linked with his, almost as a single name, that
of his subordinate officer, so that the great undertaking is not
the Lewis, but the Lewis and Clark, expedition. Clark was
to have a commission as captain, but when it came it proved
to be merely lieutenant. He took it, never grumbled, and,
when he returned, gave the commission back.
</p>

<p>
As far as the head of the Missouri apparently they would
traverse no absolutely new ground, for as has been noted the
Frenchmen had been from the Mandan villages to the eastern
slopes of the Rocky Mountains, and from the French-Spanish
settlement of St. Louis numbers of trappers and traders had
gone to the Mandan country, while the chief road to that
region had long been from the north-east by way of the lakes,
and the Assiniboine where the British fur companies had
established trading-posts. From these points their traders
reached the natives of the upper Missouri and Mississippi,
which territory the British claimed as their own. Charles
Chaboillez, one of the chief factors of the North-west Company,
was in charge of Montagne à la Basse, situated on the Assiniboine
probably about where the Verendryes' Fort la Reine had
been. From here he and other traders often went to the
Mandan country to deal with various natives who made that
region a rendezvous. He had proposed to Daniel Harmon
that they should make a journey from the Mandan towns west
to the Rocky Mountains,<a name='FA_65' id='FA_65' href='#FN_65' class='fnanchor'>[65]</a> over the course the Mandans "pursued
every spring to meet and trade with another tribe ...
which resides on the other side of the Rocky Mountain."

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
This expedition was never undertaken, but it indicates the degree
of familiarity possessed by the Mandans with the Western
country, and shows how the earlier Frenchmen found their way
out at least as far as the Yellowstone, already known as the
Roche Jaune, a name which in itself is a suggestion of early
French visitors to the great falls of that stream where the gorgeous
yellow colouring is so remarkable. Peter Fidler, another
of the British fur traders, had been down from the Saskatchewan
through the area drained by the headwaters of the Missouri.
A trader named Cruzatte had a post in 1802 at a point
two miles above old Council Bluffs, so that all through this
eastern portion of the Wilderness white men had scatteringly
penetrated. The French had been on the Saskatchewan before
the eighteenth century was half over, and ten years before
the American purchase of Louisiana Mackenzie had crossed to
the Pacific by way of Peace River Pass. But beyond the
Rocky Mountains no one appears to have been away from the
coast besides Escalante coming up from Santa Fé to Utah
Lake, and Mackenzie from Fort Chepewyan to the shore of the
Pacific at King Island (lat. 52° N.), so that the region Lewis
and Clark designed to enter beyond the mountains was absolutely
unknown territory, outside of the Amerinds themselves.

Captain Lewis was ready to start on this traverse before
the official transfer of the Louisiana region from France to the
United States had been made. His plan was to go to La
Charette, the farthest French settlement up the Missouri, a
few miles above St. Louis, and there spend the winter of
1803-04, the season being so far advanced that it was not
considered advisable to make the final start till spring opened
again and they would have a chance to go as far as possible
before another winter began. But the Spanish officers there
objected to Lewis's entering the territory and a camp was
made on the American side of the river, about opposite the
mouth of the Missouri. The purpose of the expedition was
communicated to the foreign ministers, and passports obtained
from France and Great Britain. Spain was particularly
jealous of this movement or any other which led to crossing
the Mississippi, and had opposed the right of the United States
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
by the Louisiana Purchase to anything more than the region
around New Orleans and the mouth of the Mississippi; they
resented Napoleon's selling even that. Hence Spain looked
upon the upper country as still hers. The situation, considering
the indefinite character of the whole transaction, was full of
disagreeable possibilities. Perhaps this was Napoleon's intention.
Therefore Jefferson in his instructions to Captain Lewis
particularly says: "If a superior force, authorised or unauthorised,
by a nation, should be arrayed against your further passage,
and inflexibly determined to arrest it, you must decline
its further pursuit and return." The British fur companies,
jealous of each other, were still more jealous of encroachments
on their trading grounds and their attitude toward the expedition
was uncertain.
</p>

<p>
On the 30th of April, 1803, the treaty with France ceding
Louisiana was consummated, and on June 20th Lewis's instructions
were signed and he departed for La Charette by way
of Pittsburg and the Ohio.<a name='FA_66' id='FA_66' href='#FN_66' class='fnanchor'>[66]</a> Congress ratified the purchase on
October 17th the same year. Travelling was mainly by water
in those days, and that seems to be the reason why Lewis
stuck to boat travelling when horses would have been so much
easier across the western prairies. They were permitted to return
by sea, if necessary and possible, and Lewis carried letters
of credit which would have obtained money for him in any
port, or on any ship, the world round. The object of the exploration
as announced was to find a waterway across the continent,
but Jefferson doubtless had more in view than such a
diplomatic statement would imply. Intercourse with natives,
he particularly directed, should be friendly and conciliatory.
</p>

<p>
With forty-two men and three boats Lewis and Clark left
their winter quarters on May 14, 1804, and proceeded up the
Missouri, passing the village of St. Charles, with a French Canadian
population of 450, and a little above it a small group of
American farmers. On the 25th they passed La Charette, the
last settlement, and were then fairly under way. Two rafts
were met June 12th, on one of which was a trapper named
Dorion who had been for more than twenty years among the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
Sioux. They engaged him to go with the party and this increased
the number to forty-five all told. There were nine
young men from Kentucky, fourteen American soldiers who
had volunteered, a French interpreter, a French hunter, and
a negro belonging to Clark. All but the negro were enlisted
as privates and drew pay from the Government. Besides these
there were a corporal and six soldiers, who were to turn back
at the Mandan towns, and nine <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i>. One boat was
fifty-five feet long, drawing three feet of water, with a square
sail and twenty-two oars, and was armed with a swivel at the
bow. There was a deck of ten feet at the bow and stern,
while the middle was covered with lockers which could be
raised to form a breastwork. The other boats were open, one
having six and the other seven oars. Two horses were taken
along the bank. Had they abandoned the boat idea and taken
to horses they might have gone to the mouth of the Columbia
while they were going to the Mandan towns, but they did not
know how great a bend the Missouri makes. They pushed
steadily up the river, meeting many natives and having friendly
relations with them, and the last of October arrived at the
Mandan towns, having consumed five and a half months in
making the ascent.
</p>

<p>
As soon as a proper place was found they felled trees and
built houses for the winter, calling the place Fort Mandan.
The Mandans were perfectly familiar with white men, as has
been noted, and were mainly peaceable. Lewis found here
one of the British traders, McCracken, and by him sent a note
to the chief of his home post, Chaboillez, also enclosing a copy
of his British passport. This apparently was to avoid friction
with the fur companies, and it indicates the uncertain condition
of the claim of the United States to the territory he intended
to traverse. Lewis evidently concluded a month later that
he was quite within American territory, for he forbade Laroche,<a name='FA_67' id='FA_67' href='#FN_67' class='fnanchor'>[67]</a>
another British trader, from presenting medals and
flags to the natives. Up to this time the expedition had lost
but one man. Sergeant Floyd, who died near where Sioux
City now stands, and he was the only man who was lost on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
the whole expedition. Nor were any seriously injured but
Captain Lewis, who was accidentally shot in the thigh by one
of his men who had poor eyesight and took him for an elk.
This occurred on the return not far above the mouth of the
Musselshell, and Lewis was well before they reached St. Louis.
The freedom from needless accident is strong proof of the
judgment which Lewis and Clark used in the management
of the party, for disasters are usually the result of wrong
decisions.
</p>

<p>
The winter at Fort Mandan passed pleasantly. Corn and
other supplies were bought from the natives, and there was
plenty of game. About the middle of December, a trapper
named Haney arrived from Montagne à la Basse with a note
from Chaboillez, in reply to the one sent by Lewis to him.
He offered to render any service in his power. Later the
trader Laroche came again, desiring to go with the expedition,
but Lewis declined his proposition. Laroche had previously
planned a journey in that direction which he had not carried
out. They had other visitors, among them McKenzie, one of
the principal North-west men. The intercourse with the people
of the North-west Company was entirely amicable, and there
was no friction except for a brief time, when they tried to
prevent the interpreter from continuing in Lewis and Clark's
service, and took steps to prejudice the natives. This was
not sanctioned, however, by Chaboillez or McKenzie.
</p>

<p>
On Sunday the 7th of April, 1805, all being ready, the
party again took up its line of travel up the river. It now
numbered thirty-two, the others having been sent back. The
interpreters were Drewyer (Drouillard) and Chaboneau, both
Frenchmen. Chaboneau took with him one of his three
Amerind wives, one who had a small child. This woman
Lewis and Clark hoped to utilise as an interpreter among the
Snake tribe, to whom she belonged, having been taken captive
by another tribe and finally sold to Chaboneau. Her name
was Sacajawea, and she was of great assistance, notwithstanding
the encumbrance of the child. After eight days they
passed what they called Chaboneau Creek and Sunday Island.
Chaboneau had once encamped on this creek. "Beyond this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
no white men had ever been but two Frenchmen," says the
journal. One of these, Lapage, was with them, and he could
not tell exactly how far he had gone, as they had lost their
way. But Captain Lewis does not explain, if this were correct,
how the Roche Jaune came to have its name before he reached
it, a name which could have been applied only by some one
who understood the conditions near its head. Yet farther on
he states that this river "had been known to the French as
the Roche Jaune, or as we have called it the Yellowstone."
Proceeding up the Missouri they came to the "Musselshell,"
which is stated to have been so called by the Minitarees. The
name then seems to have been a native word and has no connection
with the shells of mussels! All through this region
they saw large numbers of trees which had been cut down by
beaver, and as they proceeded the beaver were thick everywhere.
Buffalo were plentiful, and there was no dearth of
fresh meat of all kinds. Sometimes they had to take sticks to
drive the buffalo out of the way. There was one kind of game
that was troublesome—the huge bears, both white (grizzly)
and brown. If it be remembered that the guns of the party
were muzzle-loaders, that the ammunition was loose powder
and ball, that the firing apparatus was the old flint-lock, with
priming-pan, it will be seen that it was no small hazard to face
these ferocious bears. On one occasion six of the men, all
good hunters, at the same moment attacked one of the huge
brown bears, and though the bullets all took effect they were
obliged to fly to the river, where two escaped in a canoe, while
the others hid in bushes and fired repeatedly. The only effect
of this was to enrage the animal still more till the four hunters
were glad to leap down the steep bank twenty feet into the
river, whither the bear pursued them and was within a few feet
of one when a good shot from the shore hit him in the head
and at last killed him. Eight balls had passed in different
directions through him.

<p>
On May 26th, from the summit of a hill, Captain Lewis
had the first sight of the Rocky Mountains, which seemed to
be about fifty miles away. This was from a few miles below
Judith River, and the mountains seen were probably the Belt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
range. They were not the first to see the Rocky Mountains.
The French and the Spaniards had been to them farther
south. They were surrounded by immense quantities of game
from here on to the sources of the Missouri, and their larder
was always full of dainties. The river was 150 to 250 yards
wide, and they had no difficulty in ascending. There were
many signs of the aboriginal owners of the soil, particularly
old lodges. This was the country of the Minitarees, who had
described it to the leaders. It seems singular that they did
not secure two or three of these Amerinds as guides. Had
they done so, they would have been spared a good deal of
labour and considerable delay. As they toiled up the Missouri
they came at length to a point where it was difficult to tell
which of two branches to take—that is, which was the real
Missouri,—but they finally made a correct decision, and, naming
the northern branch Maria's River, continued up the left or
southern stream, when they soon arrived at the Great Falls.
Had Fidler come down as far as this it would seem that he
would have discovered these falls and would have described
them, hence as he seems not to have mentioned them it is
probable that he did not come much below the branches of
Maria's River, and that Lewis and Clark were now in the untrodden
Wilderness, untrodden by whites with the possible
exception of the Verendryes or some other Frenchman of that
period.
</p>

<p>
A portage eighteen miles long was imperative to surmount
the falls, and it was rendered more difficult by extremely hot
summer weather. A large cottonwood, the only one of the
proper diameter within miles, was felled for the purpose of
sawing from its trunk wheels with which to make a carriage
for transporting the canoes. Sacajawea had been seriously ill
since leaving Maria's River and it was fortunate for the party
that she recovered, a happy event largely assisted by draughts
from some sulphur springs found here. Here too she, together
with Captain Clark, his negro, and her husband, was nearly
lost by the flood from a cloudburst, having encamped in a
deep, dry ravine. Even to this day people have not learned
to avoid camping in the Great West, in the bottoms of ravines
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
and washes which in a few minutes may become filled by
roaring torrents.

<p>
From the head of the falls they took a fresh start, with an
additional canoe that was built there. Throughout this locality
they heard the strange booming sounds which are a feature of
the region and have not been explained. It was not long before
they were confronted by three forks of almost equal
dimensions, and they were puzzled as to which was the proper
one to choose, the easiest to arrive at the head of some Pacific
slope river. While considering the matter they bestowed the
names of Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin upon them in the
order named from west to east. At last they concluded to
ascend the Jefferson, and in this they made no mistake. They
pushed up towards its source, following Beaverhead branch,
Horse Prairie Creek, and Trail Creek, and on August 12, 1805,
Captain Lewis, who had gone somewhat in advance, came, in
Lemhi Pass, to the final rill of the Missouri and soon stood
beside another brook that swept westward to swell the flood
of the Columbia, the first white man to surmount the Backbone
of the Continent between Peace River, far to the north, and
New Mexico, far to the south. He looked out upon an absolutely
unknown portion of the Wilderness,—an area many
times that of Spain, which still claimed it. Escalante had
been from Santa Fé to Salt Lake valley, but west and north
of his route, to the head of Fraser River, no white man had
ever penetrated.

</div>

<p>
Still advancing before the main body, he met with some
stragglers from and then a band of Shoshones, some of whom
he had been anxious to meet for the purpose of securing information,
for while we speak of the country as unknown, it
was, as before noted, only so to white men. The natives
knew it perfectly. From these people he borrowed horses and
prevailed on the chief to return to the main party with him, a
proceeding the chief was doubtful about, for never before having
seen white men (though the Lewis and Clark party were so
tanned they might have passed for natives) he was fearful of
some treachery. On meeting the party, the chief discovered
that Sacajawea was his sister, who in childhood had been stolen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
by the Minitarees. The whole band were overjoyed at seeing
this woman whom they had never expected to meet again.
Proceeding to the camp of these people, a halt was made while
Captain Clark explored in advance down this Lemhi branch
and Salmon River into which it flowed. The Shoshones had
told them that the country below in this direction was too
rough to travel far in any manner, and Clark found out the
exactness of this information and returned. With guides from
the Shoshone band they then proceeded down the Lemhi
branch and over to North Fork which they mounted, thence
cutting their way across the range and descending to Ross's
Hole on the head of Bitter Root River. This stream they followed
down to the mouth of Lolo Creek, where they made
a camp called Traveller's Rest. Once more starting on their
westward way, they climbed the Bitter Root range again along
Lolo Creek, through Lolo Pass, to the head of the Clearwater
middle fork, which they called by its Amerind name,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
Kooskooskie. Passing westerly between this fork and the
north fork of the Clearwater, they finally reached a place at the
mouth of the north fork whence the natives said they could
descend in canoes, therefore they stopped here from September
26 to October 7, 1805, to build some. They were now nearer
sea level than at any time since passing Council Bluffs, for the
Wilderness is generally above two thousand feet.
</p>

<p>
The natives were kind and obliging, and though provisions
had been alarmingly scarce since leaving the Missouri, they
managed to secure enough of one kind or another, roots,
dried salmon, horse meat, dogs, and fish, to keep themselves
alive. Descending in their canoes the Clearwater, they entered
Snake River, or, as they called it, Lewis River, a junction
marked to-day by a thriving town named Lewiston in honour
of the captain. From this point they had a noble river all the
way to the end, broken by rapids, some of which were so fierce
they were forced to make portages. As one sails down
on the bosom of the Snake to-day and looks up at its towering
walls, close and precipitous, with each bend a hazy mystery
to the new voyager, he sympathises with these first explorers
who followed its torrent to the sea. They soon entered the
Columbia, sweeping down on its tremendous reaches, sighting
magnificent peaks, and finally reaching the mouth where Robert
Gray had cleaved the long line of breakers, thirteen years
before. At that time, too, Broughton, one of Vancouver's
officers, Gray having broken the way, stemmed the current of
the Columbia for about eighty miles, to Point Vancouver, near
the mouth of the Willamet. It was on November 7th that
they came in sight of the ocean and listened to the music of
the breakers, that had deceived so many excellent navigators;
a sound full of delight to these men, for it announced the
triumph of the undertaking.
</p>

<p>
Winter quarters were established on the south side at a
place not far above the mouth of the river and three miles up
a small stream called the Netul. The camp was thirty-five
feet above high tide, two hundred yards from the creek, and
seven miles east of the sea. Houses were built in a tall pine
grove and the village was named Fort Clatsop, after the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
neighbouring tribe. For some time they had been subjected
to constant rain, for the coast hereabouts is a wet one, totally
unlike the region they had passed through on the Missouri,
which is very dry. The food question continued to be the
chief one. Their diet consisted of pounded fish varied by
wapatoo roots, and some elk-meat. No serious illness occurred.
Every man was buoyed up by a desire to make the
expedition a success, and with every undertaking of this kind
success ultimately depends on the spirit of the men. The
winter wore away and they managed to evade starvation.

<p>
One writer refers to the story that a Boston brig put
in to the mouth of the river in November or December of this
year, but it seems that this story has some error in it, for if
the brig had come its captain would have been after furs, and
the natives would have known of the visit, and surely would
have mentioned it to the explorers. As they did not, it seems
that there must be an error in date and that the visit of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
brig was the following year, when her captain obtained papers
from the natives telling of Lewis and Clark's stay.
</p>

<p>
On the 23d of March, 1806, they turned their backs on Fort
Clatsop and the Western Ocean and retraced their course up
the Columbia. Like Cabeza de Vaca they had acquired fame
as healers and their services were in demand as medicine-men,
a fortunate circumstance, for they now had hardly anything to
trade. Even their clothes were made of skins. By means of
eye-water and other simple remedies they were able to purchase
an occasional horse, a few dogs, and roots and fish. The
generosity of one chief was greater than any white man would
have been likely to offer, for he told them to help themselves
to his horses without remuneration. At length they surmounted
the Lolo Pass again and dropped down on the eastern
slope of the Bitter Root range to Traveller's Rest. Here Lewis
turned up one of the eastern forks of Clark River and crossed
to the Missouri by a more direct route, while Clark followed
the Bitter Root again, and at its head crossed to the stream
they had followed out, and descended to where the canoes had
been left. With these, a party under Ordway was sent down
the river, and Clark with the rest went from the three forks to
the head of the Yellowstone. Building canoes at a point a
day or two down this river, they descended it to the Missouri,
waiting for Lewis to come to them, a little below the mouth.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the latter had gone up Maria's River and in that
locality occurred the only fatal encounter with natives of the
whole journey. With several men he was on a side trip when
they met a small party of Blackfeet. All camped together.
Before the whites were awake in the early morning, the
Amerinds attempted to run off with the guns. This move
was detected by the guard, who gave the alarm and pursued
the one who had his gun. In the scuffle for the possession of
this, Reuben Fields stabbed the Blackfoot through the heart
and the man instantly dropped dead. With a pistol Lewis,
who had been at once awakened, pursued others, who had his
gun, but being unable to overtake them, he fired, striking one
in the abdomen. Whether this man died or not is unknown,
but he lived long enough to return the shot, the ball passing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
close to Lewis's head. The Blackfeet had also driven off the
horses, but all but one were recovered, while for that one
the enemy left four of their own. Thus the white men for the
moment were victorious. It was an unfortunate episode, and
evidently an unavoidable one. It served to enrage the Blackfeet,
and turn them violently against the whites. It was not
far from here that Cruzatte blindly mistook Lewis for the elk
and put a bullet into his thigh.

They passed the camp of two white trappers, Dickson (or
Dixon) and Hancock, the first white men they had seen since
leaving Fort Mandan. These men had come out from Illinois
to trap and trade, the forerunners of a host of others eager to
make nature yield them a quick fortune. They had seen Clark
the day before and this news was welcome to Lewis, for Ordway,
with the boats, having also come safely down, the party
was soon reunited. At Mandan they found their old quarters
had been accidentally burned. White traders were frequently
met below this, for the conditions had materially changed in
the more than two years the explorers had been gone. Among
these men was Auguste Choteau, a noted man in that region;
and McClellan, a former army officer, who was planning a
journey to Santa Fé with some Pawnee and Otoe chiefs, to
exchange merchandise for the barrels of gold and silver the
Spaniards were thought to possess. The gold quest of the
Conquistadores was to be renewed, though now it was
the Spaniards who occupied the Seven Cities of Cibola. This
trade, as we shall see, developed to considerable proportions.
</p>

<p>
Lewis and Clark reached St. Louis on September 23, 1806,
and were in Washington the middle of February, 1807. Lewis
was made governor of Louisiana, Clark was raised to general
of militia of the same district as well as agent for the numerous
tribes within its area. All were given grants of 320 acres of
land and double pay. Lewis died September, 1809, on a
journey from St. Louis to Washington. Thus he did not live
to see even the beginning of the wonderful development that
occurred in the Wilderness where he had so masterfully driven
the entering wedge.

The settlements on the Rio Grande had now been continuously
occupied by the Spaniards for more than a century.
To some extent the surrounding country had been explored
in every direction, and a desultory trade was carried on with
the various Amerind tribes, particularly with those of the
plains and the northern region, from all of whom they obtained
furs in exchange for articles of European make, exactly as the
British were doing in the Far North, and the Americans in the
East. They were therefore known far and wide, even to tribes
which did not directly deal with them. Santa Fé at this period,
1805, may therefore be regarded as the metropolis of the vaster
Wilderness. It had a population of about 4500, with two
churches, and covered about a mile of ground in length, a
distance which was longitudinally divided by three streets.
Agriculture was practised by means of irrigation, a system
which natives had operated ages before. By it, an abundance
of maize, melons, beans, peppers, squashes, peaches, grapes,
etc., were produced, and as there were also plenty of sheep
and cattle, life on the Rio Grande in New Mexico was by no
means severe, indeed it had a kind of <i><span lang="it_IT">dolce far niente</span></i> quality
that clings round it still. The routes from the eastward to
reach this elysium were not unknown, and would more often
have been travelled had it not been for the restrictions of the
Spanish Government.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
</p>

<p>
One route across Texas passed through the town of San
Antonio, with a population of about two thousand, and in
Texas there were at that time besides the people of San Antonio
about five thousand others, a mixture of Spanish creoles,
some French, some Americans, and a few civilised natives.
Another road was by way of Red River, and still another, the
least known, by way of the Arkansas. At Lemhi Pass, Lewis
and Clark had heard from a Ute of these towns about twenty
days' journey to the south, and at Council Bluffs others had
stated that Santa Fé was twenty-five days' journey from there.
One white man, McClellan, was planning a tour to Santa Fé
about the time of Lewis and Clark's return, and it is said that
certain Mallet brothers with six others, before the end of the
eighteenth century, went up from St. Louis and struck from
the Missouri to the Rio Grande settlements. One Baptiste
LaLande, in the employ of Morrison, an American merchant,
had gone there in 1804 with goods to trade, but had never
returned, for he found the country attractive and himself out
of reach of his employer. All merchandise for the Rio Grande
settlements was brought by a long, difficult road from Mexico,
and prices were enormous by the time the goods arrived at
Santa Fé. The government and the governor too had to
have their bonus. The Americans knew of these conditions,
and hence early began to speculate on the possibility of transporting
merchandise overland from St. Louis to compete. As
the governor and the government were everything in that
region, and permission to trade, to trap, or merely to enter or
leave the land had to be first obtained from the autocratic
head, going to Santa Fé to trade and entering or approaching
the Spanish domain in any way were not trifling matters;
more particularly as the point at which American jurisdiction
ended and that of Spain began was as uncertain as the point
where the north wind ceased to blow. Few Americans therefore
had attempted it. The first to make the entry did so
almost involuntarily. He was a man from Kentucky, James
Pursley, who was trapping in the region west of St. Louis in
1802—before the purchase of Louisiana by the United States.
</p>

<p>
Like so many of the Americans of that time brought up to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
the frontier life, he was perfectly familiar with every danger,
and with all the peculiarities of the Amerind character; and
he was of dauntless courage and limitless perseverance.
Nothing ever baulked this type of man, of whom Daniel
Boone was a fine specimen. Battered and thrust down by
fortune till it would seem impossible for anything human to
rise above the circumstances, they mastered them as if merely
remounting a mustang from which they had momentarily been
unseated. So it was that Pursley ploughed his way to Santa
Fé with no original intention of going there. Some of the
Kansa tribe having stolen the horses of his party, Pursley
happened to see his own being ridden by one of that tribe to
water. Without a moment's hesitation, Pursley pursued him,
and discovering that he could not get the horse, ripped open
the animal's bowels with his hunting knife. The Kansa thereupon
tried to shoot him, but the gun missed fire, and Pursley,
with the knife, chased the man into the camp, where he was
unable to get him because he hid in a tent surrounded by
women and children. Other white men were there at the moment
and saw the whole thing. The chiefs of the tribe were
so much astonished and delighted at Pursley's courage that
they caused all the horses to be returned to him.

He and his partners then went back to their cache intending
to take their goods to St. Louis, but a second time their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
horses were stolen. Thereupon they built a canoe and sailed
down the Osage, but when near its mouth they were capsized,
and with the exception of their arms and ammunition, lost
everything they possessed. Just at this disheartening moment
along came a barge bound for the upper Missouri. Pursley
joined this company, and arriving in the Mandan country, he
was sent on an expedition to trade with some Paducas and
Kiowas. They were all driven by Sioux into the mountains
at the head of the Platte. The natives with whom they were,
some two thousand in number, desired to trade with the
Spaniards, but not knowing how they might be received, they
finally sent Pursley with his white men, and two of their own
kind, to Santa Fé to interview Governor Allencaster. The
latter not objecting to their trading, the two Amerinds returned
with that information to their waiting brethren, while Pursley
and his men, having been rather dubious about ever arriving
again among whites, were quite content to remain in the
Spanish towns. They arrived in June, 1805, and Pursley took
up the practice of his trade of carpenter, earning considerable
money by it. He had been in the habit of making his own
gunpowder in Kentucky, and tried doing it here, but on his
operations being discovered he came near being hung. He
was forbidden to write, but was told he could have a passport
whenever he wanted it, though they exacted security that he
would not leave without permission.
</p>

<p>
Another man, whose name was soon to be written for all
time upon the face of this particular region, was at this moment
preparing for the first of two important undertakings.

<p>
The uncertainty of the sources of the Mississippi and of
the northern boundary of Louisiana impelled the astute Jefferson
to arrange for other explorations in that quarter before
the return of Lewis and Clark. For this work a young, brave,
and capable officer, Lieutenant Zebulon Montgomery Pike,
was chosen.<a name='FA_68' id='FA_68' href='#FN_68' class='fnanchor'>[68]</a> He proceeded to St. Louis, and in August,
1805, with a keel boat seventy feet long, and a crew of one
sergeant, two corporals, and seventeen privates, provisioned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
for four months, started to explore the Father of Waters to
its uppermost rill. The Amerinds of this region had a great
dread of the Americans, considering them quarrelsome and
warlike, hence they would often go out of the way to avoid a
meeting. Yet Pike was
generally well received
and one influential chief
gave him a special peace
pipe to show to the
Sioux above as a sort
of passport. It was a
request to have him
treated with friendship
and respect. At one of
the villages this friendship
and respect were
indicated by a salute
from the guns of a party
on shore. The guns
were loaded with ball
and, inasmuch as their
owners were drunk,
they tried to see how
near the boat they could
strike without actually
hitting it. Notwithstanding
their undesirable
condition, Pike
presented them later
with several gallons of
rum, an action which
seems hardly pardonable
in a government officer, yet this issuing to the natives of
intoxicants was common among all officers, traders, and all
managers of fur companies. They knew its diabolical effect,
as well as its debasing and generally demoralising quality, yet
they all did it. Of course the ordinary fur trader desired to
intoxicate the natives in order to overreach them, and traded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
whiskey, or rather alcohol and water, for their goods because
in this way he made a profit of several hundred per cent. The
great fur companies each used it in their trade because the
others did; but with the officers of the United States Army
there was no excuse for employing this means of gaining the
Amerind favour.
</p>

<p>
The expedition mounted the river without any serious
drawback, and the boats, increased to four all told, were
Pike's pride, for he exclaims on one occasion: "Our four boats
under full sail, their flags streaming before the wind, were
altogether a prospect so variegated and romantic that a man
may scarce expect to enjoy such a one but twice or thrice in
the course of his life." They sailed across Lake Pepin with
violins playing, and other music, and altogether seemed to
enjoy their voyage. In this region Jonathan Carver was supposed
to have travelled in 1766-68, and since that time the fur
traders from the north and north-east had operated all over it.
When Lewis and Clark were at their Fort Mandan, a man
named Haney visited the place, and they obtained from him
"much geographical information with regard to the country
between the Missouri and Mississippi and the various tribes of
Sioux who inhabit it." Pike found there a number of agents
and trappers belonging to the British fur companies and protested
against their occupying the country. Everything was
amicable between them, and after a winter spent in the region
Pike returned, by the river, to St. Louis, the last of April,
1806, about the time that Lewis and Clark were toiling up the
Columbia on their return.
</p>

<p>
A little more than two months before Lewis and Clark
arrived at St. Louis, Pike was again on the march, this time
with his steps directed toward the mighty peak which now
bears his name, and which afterwards evolved itself into the
famous motto of the caravans, "Pike's peak or bust." It
was July 15, 1806, when he made his start on this traverse of
the plains and mountains, apparently with no information
as to the route, with no guides, and with no proper equipment.
Of course he had no intention of blundering around
the high mountains in dead of winter, but it was an impossibility
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
for any party to accomplish the journey out to the
head of Red River and back before cold weather should set
in, therefore, with all the uncertainty, they should have been
provided with winter clothing, but they had nothing of the
kind. I should say they had hardly enough of anything for
even a summer campaign. However, where ignorance is bliss,
preliminary suffering is avoided. He was directed to escort a
number of rescued Amerind captives back to their tribe, and
with these he left St. Louis. The whole party consisted of
one lieutenant, one surgeon, one sergeant, two corporals, sixteen
privates, one interpreter, and fifty-one natives of all ages.
Up the Missouri, which somebody has styled the "Mother of
Floods,"<a name='FA_69' id='FA_69' href='#FN_69' class='fnanchor'>[69]</a> in two boats, they worked their way for six weeks
to the Osage River. Here the boats were sold for a hundred
dollars and horses were purchased with which to continue.
</p>

<p>
The Spaniards on this expedition kept a jealous eye, as
indeed they did on any party from the United States into the
region beyond the Missouri.<a name='FA_70' id='FA_70' href='#FN_70' class='fnanchor'>[70]</a> A strong force in fact had been
sent to intercept Pike. This had gone as far as the Sabine,
and then northerly to the Republican fork, the very place
where Pike soon after arrived and found the trail of his prospective
captors. The relations of the United States and
Spain were much strained owing to the Louisiana transaction.
The Spaniards were endeavouring to limit Louisiana as much
as possible, while on the other hand the claims of the United
States were as broad as the most liberal conception of the extent
of Louisiana could formulate, and as Louisiana never had
possessed any real demarkation it is easy to see how far apart
the two countries on this subject were. In the region farther
down the river, in the Texas and Orleans districts, the situation
was precarious. While Pike was fitting out, information
of his intentions was forwarded by Spanish agents to their
Government. The large armed force whose trail Pike had now
fallen upon was the result. According to Pike, who afterwards
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
learned all about it from its commander, Malgares, it had three
objects: first, to descend Red River, and if Pike was met to
turn him back; second, to explore the country to the Missouri;
third, to visit a number of the native tribes, make them presents,
and renew the chain of ancient friendship between "his
most catholic majesty and the red people." Furthermore,
the commanding officer had orders to compel all parties in this
country to retire to the acknowledged territory of the United
States, or to make prisoners of them and take them to New
Mexico. So the position of Spain with regard to the region
lying along the Missouri River was entirely plain.
</p>

<p>
It was fortunate that they did not meet with Pike till he
was worn out by exposure and famine, for he certainly would
have given battle. But Malgares, who was a man of "large
fortune, generous, well educated, with a high sense of honour,"
was later under different circumstances very kind to Pike, and
to the surgeon, Dr. Robinson, so that both became much
attached to him.
</p>

<p>
On his march he gathered in every American trader and
trapper he found and some of these he sent to Nachitoches,
a Spanish post in Texas, where Pike afterwards found them
existing in abject poverty. The army was made up of one
hundred dragoons from the province of Biscay, who had fitted
out on reaching Santa Fé, and were there joined by five hundred
mounted militia, equipped for six months. Each man
led two horses and a mule, making in all over two thousand
head of stock. Down Red River they had gone some 233
miles, before turning to the north-east to reach the Arkansas,
where Malgares left 240 of his men with the worn-out stock,
while with the rest he kept on to the village of the Pawnee
Republic, on the Republican fork of the Kansas River, where
he held councils with various tribes of Pawnees. It was about
here that the unfortunate Villazur party met its sad fate in
1720, and the recollection of that affair now produced in the
Spanish soldiers a desire rather to revenge the treachery
against Villazur by destroying the Pawnees, than to promote
the repairing of the slender links of the ancient amity chain.
In addition to this they seem to have grown discontented.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
These considerations and the lame condition of the stock prevented
Malgares from advancing farther or from waiting to
intercept Pike, and he was obliged to take the back track; a
lucky thing for the small American party. By October he
was in Santa Fé, where his militia disbanded, but he remained
there with the regular troops. He was well out of Pike's way,
as it was the end of September before the American party
came upon the trail of the Spaniards on the Republican fork.

</div>

<p>
This was probably the region that Coronado reached in his
eastward march two and a half centuries earlier—and it was
little different from what it was at that time.
</p>

<p>
Pike immediately demanded from the Pawnees the Spanish
flag which Malgares had given them in token of their allegiance
to the Spanish king, and he presented them instead with
a flag of the United States; but he finally returned the Spanish
flag on condition that it should not be displayed during his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
stay. The Pawnee chief on his part urged Pike to turn back,
and admitted that he had agreed with the Spaniards to stop
him, but the American officer, whatever faults he may have
had, was not of a temper to be easily stopped, and probably
the Pawnee chief observed this, for he made no attempt to
prevent the expedition from proceeding. He told a good deal
about the Spanish visit which Pike recorded, but these papers
and all others were taken from him later. Here they heard
the pleasant news of the safe return of Lewis and Clark, and
doubtless Pike looked forward to an equally brilliant accomplishment.
But he had to deal with an additional factor or
obstacle, the Spaniards, and consequently, as he persisted in
putting his head in the lion's mouth, it closed upon him.
Lewis and Clark had certain other advantages in threading the
unknown Wilderness; the natives there had not yet been deceived,
swindled, and unjustly shot, and the British had no
force in that quarter to interrupt their progress even if such a
desire had been present in the British mind: the Spaniards
were even more handicapped. Pike, on the other hand, was
on a sort of highway, where the Spaniards had already been
searching for him. After delivering his wards at their home
camp, he kept on his westward way, following the trail of
Malgares, where it was not obliterated by the bison herds,
reaching the Arkansas, and then pursuing a course up that
stream. On October 28th, Lieutenant Wilkinson was sent
back with letters. His party descended the Arkansas with
two boats, one a skin canoe, in which he embarked with three
soldiers and an Osage, and a wooden canoe with the baggage,
manned by another soldier and an Osage, while one more
soldier walked along the shore.
</p>

<p>
Pike's plan was to follow up the Arkansas as far as the
mountains or as the Comanches, and then go south to Red
River, returning home by this stream.<a name='FA_71' id='FA_71' href='#FN_71' class='fnanchor'>[71]</a> Had he not deviated
from this plan it is likely that his expedition would have been
able to return without serious suffering, but he departed from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
it when he reached the mountains, there turning north to find
Red River, instead of south as he had intended. On November
15th, as they were pushing along on the wide plain, he
thought he detected the suggestion of the great range, and
half an hour later the splendid line of peaks came in full view.
Then "the Mexican mountains were cheered three times," but
had they realised the amount of suffering and misery they were
to endure amidst those enticing forms, these cheers instead
would have been tears, bitter tears. They were now filled
with the idea of arriving the next day at the foot of the long
line of billowy enchantment, but the following night they
seemed no nearer than before. They here, however, had
plenty to eat, and feasted on marrow bones, for enormous
herds of buffalo encompassed them. They had the wisdom
to dry a large supply of the meat to carry along; but it ought
to have been far larger. On the 22d a war party of Grand
Pawnees was encountered, and Pike was fearful of a clash,
which indeed was always imminent in the region they had now
entered, extending along the eastern base of the mountains
and termed later the "War Road," or "Hostile Ground,"
because it seemed to be a sort of lawless area, where every
tribe felt at liberty to attack anything that came in its way.
There were sixty of the Pawnees and only sixteen of the
Americans, so that the battle would have been uneven, half
of the Pawnees being armed with guns. But they had a powwow,
and the Amerinds asked for corn, ammunition, blankets,
etc. Pike gave them presents and invited them to smoke and
eat,—an invitation which was accepted, and the relations were
not unpleasant till the Americans began to pack up, when the
Pawnees took to stealing what they could. Thereupon Pike
announced to them that he would kill the next one who
touched the baggage, which had the proper effect, and each
party continued on its own way.
</p>

<p>
On the 24th of November they arrived at the "Grand
Fork"—that is, at about the place where Pueblo, Colorado,
now stands. Here they made a sort of fort, or as Pike calls
it a "breastwork," of logs for the protection of the main body
which Pike designed to leave here while he, with three of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
men, should scout up the North Fork, or Fontaine qui Bouille.
This was the first establishment of any kind by Americans,
near the site of Pueblo, or in any part of Colorado.
</p>

<p>
In thirty-four miles Pike reached the foot of the mountains
and climbed to the summit of one where the snow was middle
deep. The cold was intense, and the party suffered greatly,
as they were not clothed for winter. In fact they could
hardly be said to be clothed at all, for they had only overalls
and no socks. Expeditions in fitting out are inclined to go to
extremes. They either show an absurd contempt for equipment
and neglect essentials, or they load themselves down
with luxuries.<a name='FA_72' id='FA_72' href='#FN_72' class='fnanchor'>[72]</a> In breaking the Wilderness the majority of
parties were inadequately supplied, especially with food.
Pike's was a good sample of this lack of foresight. Lewis and
Clark fall somewhat in the same category, but they had good
luck. From the summit on which Pike stood he could see the
"Grand Peak" about fifteen miles away, the same which afterwards
was given his name, and to-day is one of the most celebrated
mountains in the world, because it is not only high and
beautiful, but for many years stood an emblem of the danger
and privation endured by those who entered within the radius
of its shining top.

</div>

<p>
Returning to the main camp where the men were suffering
from lack of clothing and blankets, Pike led the way, not
south to the headwaters of Red River, but on up the Arkansas.
Just what his idea was is difficult to comprehend. They
had bad weather, a great deal of snow, and severe cold.
Under the circumstances, the only sensible thing to have
done, was to find a good place for a camp, and from that point
reconnoitre thoroughly before making the next move. This
would have spared them an immense amount of hardship, and
it seems to me what sound judgment would have directed.
Had they done this, they would have found the trails leading
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
toward the Spanish settlements and the heads of the Canadian
and Red rivers. But, instead, they went blunderingly on,
entirely unprepared for winter in any climate, yet deliberately
climbing to heights where they would be in that of the North
Pole. They finally found themselves on the head of the
South Platte. Here they saw signs of a large party they
thought was that of Malgares, but it was natives. Then their
troubles increased, mainly because they had no suspicion of
where they ought to go and were unprepared for going anywhere.
They blindly followed the Platte for a day or two and
then concluded to strike south-west to find Red River. The
result was they got on the head of the Arkansas again. They
had neither clothing, blankets, nor shoes. Had they encamped
in the beginning at the foot of the mountains, they
might have provided themselves abundantly with all three.
At length they made a sled to carry the baggage, and after
a while divided into eight parties, all travelling at different
rates.
</p>

<p>
Pike now saw that he was not on Red River at all, but he
believed he had seen the headwaters of "La Platte, the Arkansaw,
and the Pierre Jaune," and here perhaps is a solution
of the object of his aimless wandering. He wanted to make
some great discovery. He was correct on the designation of
his first two rivers, but not on the third, for the Roche Jaune
which he meant, in English the Yellowstone, takes its rise
at least three hundred miles north of his position. After a
great deal of wearisome travel, and suffering from cold and
famine, they arrived at the same spot where they had encamped
on December 10th, at the mouth of what is now
Currant Creek above Cañon City. A week later Pike decided
to build a fort here for the protection of the baggage, and
leave the interpreter and one other to guard it, while with
packs on their backs all the rest were to strike out afresh across
the mountain for Red River. On the 14th of January, 1807,
they started. Each carried forty-five pounds and some provisions,
making with his arms a load of about seventy pounds,
no very easy weight to carry continuously, day after day. Proceeding
southward through Wet Mountain valley they finally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
came to the head of the Huerfano, and then saw the great
White Mountain, or Blanca Peak.<a name='FA_73' id='FA_73' href='#FN_73' class='fnanchor'>[73]</a> Nine of the men now
frosted their feet, and on the 20th, three days after, two were
in such a condition they could not proceed, and on the 22d
they were left behind in as comfortable circumstances as were
possible. All the provisions, except enough for one meal,
were left with them. Food had been a scarcer thing than ever
with the party, and a day or two before, Pike was so exhausted
that he nearly swooned.
</p>

<p>
At last, on the 28th of January, they stumbled on a trail
leading down the "White Mountains" (Sierra Blanca), a trail
which had been worked by men and had hieroglyphs cut on
trees. This was through Mosca Pass, 9700 feet altitude, and
following it westward they soon saw the Rio Grande flowing
southward, and thought at last they had found the object of
their search. But more disappointments were in preparation.
They were now in San Luis valley after an immense amount
of misery and exhaustion which were entirely unnecessary.
Had they sensibly reconnoitred from their breastwork at the
Pueblo site, they would have discovered the Pueblo-Ute-Spanish
trails across the mountains to San Luis valley, by
way of Veta and of Sangre de Cristo passes. They could also
have found the headwaters of the Canadian, and those of Red
River. They need not have suffered for food or clothing, and
they would have saved time, and perhaps have avoided the
Spaniards, if Pike really intended to do so.
</p>

<p>
Here they shot deer and supplied themselves with meat,
and on a large west branch, Rio Conejos, a fort was built about
five miles from the junction, on the north bank. This was
thirty-six feet square, of heavy logs, twelve feet high, protected
at the top by sharp stakes slanting over for about thirty
inches. Around this they made a moat four feet wide, filled
with water. It is evident that Pike saw here signs of Spaniards,
and expected trouble even though he supposed he
was on Red River and considered himself within American
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
territory.<a name='FA_74' id='FA_74' href='#FN_74' class='fnanchor'>[74]</a> The Spaniards did not so consider Red River, as
is entirely clear from the expedition of Malgares. No matter
where they found Pike, they intended to turn him back
or take him prisoner. The doctor, Robinson, left the party
now and continued on to Santa Fé, his pretext for entering
being Morrison's claim against the dishonest LaLande,
Morrison having requested him to settle the matter.
</p>

<p>
Some men were now sent back to bring in those left behind,
but poor Sparks and Dougherty, the ones who had frozen their
feet, could not travel; they sent instead, to prove it, bones
they had taken out. On the 26th, two Frenchmen visited the
fort with information that a detachment of Spanish soldiers
was coming to protect the Americans from an attack by the
Utes. A few days before this a Spanish dragoon with a Pueblo
had come, and the following day, the 17th of February, they
went away. They had been sent out on the arrival at Santa
Fé of Dr. Robinson. The body that was now approaching
was therefore aware of the situation and accordingly acted
with great diplomacy. Pike considered it deception, as indeed
it was, but in the end this method was better for all concerned
than a cold demand for surrender. Fifty dragoons and fifty
mounted militia appeared under command of Don Ignacio
Salleto, who was politeness itself. He was very careful not
to ruffle Pike's pride. They had breakfast and then Don
Ignacio put in operation his diplomacy. He said: "Señor, the
Governor of New Mexico being informed you had missed your
route, ordered me to offer you in his name mules, horses,
money, or whatever you may stand in need of to conduct you
to the head of Red River, as from Santa Fé to where it is
sometimes navigable is eight days' journey, and we have guides
and the routes of traders to conduct us."
</p>

<p>
"What," exclaimed Pike, "is not this Red River?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Señor, the Rio del Norte."
</p>

<p>
Pike immediately ordered his flag to be taken down, for
he considered he had committed trespass. From the Spanish
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
point of view he had been a trespasser ever since he left the
Missouri, and had he been on Red River it would have made
no difference to them. As soon as he consented to go to
Santa Fé to visit the governor, Don Ignacio ordered his men to
supply the Americans with blankets and provisions, and from
this time on they were comfortably fed again. The next day
Pike discovered the agreeable Don Ignacio writing a letter addressed
to the Governor, thus proving that he was not himself
going on with Pike, and that the whole American company
were really under arrest. They would not have been able to
resist, anyhow, in their destitute condition. It was too late
to change circumstances, so Pike went with the escort down
the river. On the road at one of the villages Baptiste LaLande
tried to play the spy upon them, but did not succeed. Arriving
at Santa Fé, Governor Allencaster treated Pike politely,
but he never swerved from his purpose of securing all of Pike's
papers to send to headquarters. The conversation with the
Governor was carried on in French, a language which neither
appears to have wielded fluently.
</p>

<p>
"You came to reconnoitre our country?" said the Governor.
</p>

<p>
"I marched to reconnoitre my own," said Pike.
</p>

<p>
"In what character are you?" asked the Governor.
</p>

<p>
"In my proper character, an officer of the United States
Army," replied Pike.
</p>

<p>
Here he met Pursley, who had been nearly two years in
Santa Fé, and who told him he had found gold on the head of
the Platte, and had carried some of it about with him in his
shot pouch for months, till he believed he would never again
reach civilisation and threw it away. This is the first American
mention of gold existing in that region. He told the
Spaniards about it, and they wanted him to show the way, but
he concluded it was on American territory, and also that such
a discovery might interfere with his leaving the country.
Copper mining was going on in New Mexico at a place down
the river below Socorro.
</p>

<p>
All the Americans were treated well at Santa Fé, and
presently were sent under escort to headquarters of General
Salcedo, at Chihuahua. The commander of the troop was
Malgares, the same who had made the fruitless tour to the
Pawnee country to intercept Pike. The journey to Chihuahua
was most agreeable, for Pike and Dr. Robinson had become
well acquainted at Santa Fé with Malgares and had found him
a delightful personality. Robinson says, "He was a gentleman,
a soldier, and one of the most gallant men you ever
knew," consequently, excepting the fact that they were
prisoners, the route southward, in the splendid sunny air of
New Mexico and Old, was agreeable enough. The Americans
were everywhere well received by persons in authority, and
there was nothing to complain of in this respect.
</p>

<p>
General Salcedo was as polite as Allencaster, and, though
he considered the invasion "an offence of magnitude," on
full consideration it was decided to return the Americans to
their own country. Accordingly, they were sent back by way
of San Antonio and Nachitoches.
</p>

<p>
Geographically, Pike's expedition added little to American
knowledge of the Wilderness, yet it served to make clearer the
conditions existing between the Missouri and the foot of the
mountains. Politically it emphasised the claims of the United
States in that direction, but much remained to be adjusted
before anything definite could come out of the chaos.

<p>
The fine profits obtained by the British fur companies, combined
with the information of the enormous numbers of
beaver existing in the Rocky Mountains, brought back by
Lewis and Clark and the trappers who had followed at their
heels, gave a sudden impetus to the movement of Americans
into the new Louisiana acquisition. The expedition of Pike
had marked the trail to Santa Fé and indicated possibilities of
profitable overland trade with New Mexico when the Spanish
Government should modify its restrictions. Notwithstanding,
therefore, that nobody knew just where Spanish territory began
and where that of the United States ended, American
hunters and trappers crossed into the Wilderness by scores.
Even the sparsely settled districts of the Ohio valley proved
irksome to them, and in the lead was the veteran Daniel
Boone, who with fourscore years upon him turned his back
upon the land he had done so much to win, and settled at La
Charette, the French village beyond St. Louis.
</p>

<p>
And St. Louis, half Spanish, half French, had now become
part American. Being the point of departure for all parts of
the Wilderness, even the region of the upper Missouri, to
which attention was now mainly directed, it began every day
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
to increase in size and importance. Maxent, La Clede, and
Company were operating from this point before the cession to
the United States, and so was the artful and slippery Manuel
Lisa, who was believed to have no liking for Americans, or for
any other competitors, and who, justly or unjustly, was looked
upon with suspicion by every trapper who ventured up the
river. Lisa annually sent trading parties in that direction,
and in 1807 he made the journey himself. Perhaps he was no
worse than the other traders, every one of whom was striving
to thwart the success of rivals. He was about thirty-five years
old, and in cunning and business intrigue a match for the
keenest. In these respects he was the opposite of another
noted character of the time, Auguste Choteau, a French
creole, whose integrity and agreeable personality made him
as much liked as Lisa was mistrusted. On Lisa's trip up the
river he seems to have had with him the trapper Potts, who
had been one of the Lewis and Clark party; and later he employed
another of that party, Colter, who had obtained his
release from Lewis on the return trip when they met Dixon
and Hancock.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
Colter and Potts were sent trapping in the Blackfoot
country. These people were in a revengeful mood because of
the fatal encounter with Lewis on Maria's River, and Colter
and Potts were on the alert to elude them, but they were discovered.
As they pushed their canoe into the stream, an
arrow struck Potts. He then fired and killed a man. Instantly
he was riddled by arrows. Colter made no resistance.
He was taken on shore and stripped. They thought of setting
him up as a target, but the chief gave him a chance for his life,
which indicates that they were not in so ferocious a temper as
has been assumed, for had they been bent on blood atonement
for the deaths on Maria's River they would have given Colter
no chance at all. They were willing to make a game of it.
The chance that was given was to lead the captive out on the
prairie, about four hundred yards in advance of the band, and
let him go to save himself if he could. They did not shoot at
him. It was to be a pure test of speed. Colter ran fast, for
he was a good runner and life was the prize. Only one pursuer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
gained. He drew nearer and nearer. Colter stopped,
turned round, and threw up his hands. The blood, owing to
his severe exertion, had flowed from his nostrils and covered
his body, making a startling spectacle. The Blackfoot, surprised,
tried to halt and throw his spear, but exhausted, he
fell, breaking the spear as he went down. Colter thrust the
sharp point into the man's heart, and rushed on for Jefferson
River. This he reached while the Blackfeet stopped at their
fallen comrade, and plunging in he swam to an island, dived
under a large pile of driftwood, and raised his head above water
amidst the sticks. The pursuers mounted the pile and ranged,
the whole island all day long, but it did not occur to them to
dive in the search. Night fell. All grew quiet. Colter swam
gently down a long distance, and then started for Lisa's fort,
where, after seven days' hard travel and exposure, he arrived.
</p>

<p>
Lisa went back to St. Louis the next year, 1808, but Colter
remained till 1810. He passed through the geyser region of
the Yellowstone, and is said to have been the first white man
to go there. Inasmuch, however, as the Yellowstone was
named before Lewis and Clark made their journey, and by
Frenchmen, it seems probable that these same Frenchmen had
visited the geyser region. They certainly were at the great
canyon, for, as before noted, they would not otherwise have
applied the name Yellowstone. Colter, therefore, more exactly
may be said to have been the first American in the geyser
basin. When he arrived at St. Louis again, he met there the
English naturalist Bradbury, who printed the story of his race
for life in the book he wrote, from which it has been transcribed
many times. As it was a famous incident, I venture
to give it again in a much condensed form.<a name='FA_75' id='FA_75' href='#FN_75' class='fnanchor'>[75]</a>
</p>

<p>
About this time Henry, one of Lisa's trappers, being
obliged to abandon his post at the three forks, because of the
hostility of the Blackfeet, passed over to the headwaters of the
Snake and built a trading-post there, the very first establishment
by an American on the Pacific slope, excepting Fort
Clatsop, of Lewis and Clark, at the mouth of the Columbia.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
This fort of Henry's was built about three years later than the
one Fraser founded for the North-west Company near latitude
54.

<p>
The shrewd Lisa perceived that power was necessary in the
fur business to secure the greatest profit, and as this required
combination, he established, in the winter of 1808-09, the
Missouri Fur Company, with William Morrison as one of the
partners. At almost the same moment, a keen business man
of New York, John Jacob Astor, obtained a charter from the
State of New York for the American Fur Company. Encountering
the rivalry of the Mackinaw Company, he arranged
with some of the members of the North-west Company to buy
it out, and they obtained possession in 1811. Meanwhile, the
possibilities of the North-west and the region traversed by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
Lewis and Clark appealed to Astor's business sense, and in
1810 he organised another company to operate from the mouth
of the Columbia, called the Pacific Fur Company. His plan
was to establish a line of trading-posts along the Missouri and
Columbia to the Pacific, where, at the mouth of the Columbia,
a chief station was to be maintained, to receive furs and distribute
supplies. An annual ship was to keep this post in
touch with New York. The scheme was entirely feasible, but
in the execution of it every circumstance appeared to conspire
for defeat. Some enterprises float easily across every obstacle,
while others seem to create barriers which grow to enormous
proportions.
</p>

<p>
When Fraser established his post west of the Rocky Mountains
in 1806, it was intended that he should move down and
explore all the country to the southward. Later another
party was dispatched under David Thompson especially to
forestall Astor's people at the mouth of the Columbia. Astor,
himself, endeavoured to conciliate the British companies by
offering them a third interest in his Pacific Company, but
they declined. He next engaged a number of North-west
men for his enterprise, to gain the advantage of their experience,
but in this he seems to have made a mistake. As Great
Britain and the United States were on the verge of war, it
would have been better if the concern had been made purely
American. In prominent positions there were only two citizens
of the Republic: Wilson Price Hunt, of New Jersey,
chief agent; and Jonathan Thorn, a lieutenant of the United
States Navy, on leave to command the first supply ship, the
<i>Tonquin</i>, a vessel doomed to strange destruction. The new
company organised on June 23, 1810, Astor holding one half
of the hundred shares, while the other half was distributed
among the several partners. Hunt was to go overland and
remain at the chief station five years.<a name='FA_76' id='FA_76' href='#FN_76' class='fnanchor'>[76]</a>
</p>

<p>
Some of the partners were to go by the <i>Tonquin</i>. These
were all British subjects, Scotchmen. There were, besides,
mechanics, and thirteen <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i>, the latter coming down
from Canada in a birch-bark canoe by way of Lake Champlain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
and the Hudson, singing gaily as they came. Could they have
foreseen the future, the song would have died in their throats.
Of all the expeditions ever set on foot, this one, perhaps, met
with the most continuous disaster. Although well planned,
the Fates appeared to be opposed in this direction to Astor's
success. The British had an eye on it and intended to baulk
it if they could. For one thing they meant to stop the <i>Tonquin</i>
and impress the <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i>, which they thought would
cripple the enterprise. The <i>Constitution</i>, the ship soon to
make its name forever famous, was sent for some distance as
a convoy, but nothing happened except that the <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i>
became seasick, and the foreign partners and Captain Thorn
failed to harmonise. Thorn looked upon them with suspicion,
and did not conceal his opinion that they were working against
the company's interests. He particularly disliked McDougall
who was next to Hunt in authority.
</p>

<p>
Thorn was a capable officer on the high seas, and he sailed
the <i>Tonquin</i> successfully from the starting day, September 10,
1810, to that on which he arrived at the mouth of the Columbia,
March 22, 1811. Then he seems to have lost his caution.
Instead of lying off to wait for favourable weather to run the
breakers, he immediately ordered chief mate Fox, a seaman,
John Martin, and three <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i>, notwithstanding Fox's
protest and that of the partners, to reconnoitre the entrance
in a small boat. They were never seen again. The wind
abating, two days later the ship anchored under Cape Disappointment.
Search was made for the missing men, but with
no result. The <i>Tonquin</i> then approached the bar, but the
captain was afraid to run through, and sent the second mate
in the pinnace to pilot the way. He was nearly lost. Another
attempt was made, but the ship struck on the bar repeatedly,
and the waves broke over her. The pinnace, which had again
attempted to pilot, was swept away with five men on board,
while the ship, in great danger of complete wreck, came to
anchor in seven fathoms. At last they got under Cape Disappointment
once more, and were safe. On searching the
coast for the lost men of the pinnace, only two were found.
Thus eight lives were sacrificed to the bull-headedness of this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
crusty captain. It was a full measure of what was in store for
the ill-fated enterprise. Had Thorn used a small amount of
common sense, he could have passed the bar without losing a
man.
</p>

<p>
At length the <i>Tonquin</i> was inside, and after much wrangling
between the captain and the foreign partners, a settlement was
begun on what they called Point George. To this the name
Astoria was given in honour of the head of the company.
When the supplies had been landed, the <i>Tonquin</i> went up the
coast to trade, with McKay to direct. Against the advice of
the interpreter, a native from down the coast, they anchored
in Neweetee Bay on the southern end of Vancouver Island.
McKay went ashore and was well received, for six natives were
held on board as hostages. The people of this bay had a bad
reputation, which perhaps means that they saw through the
game of the traders. Great numbers came the following
morning to trade and as they sought high prices, doubtless
one per cent. of real value, Thorn grew angry and threw the
chief overboard. When McKay returned, the interpreter
urged immediate departure, but Thorn scorned his advice.
Astor had particularly instructed not to allow many natives on
board at one time, but this was ignored. Next morning they
came again with their furs; canoe after canoe arrived till the
deck was thronged. The captain saw indications of trouble.
He ordered men aloft to make sail while others weighed
anchor. The natives were eager to trade, especially for
knives, and they quickly obtained a great many, so that when
the command was given to clear ship, they uttered a yell and
fell upon the unprepared crew.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Thorn fought desperately, for he was no coward, and
though he had only a clasp knife, he killed several before a
blow from behind laid him low forever. Four of the men aloft
succeeded in gaining the cabin alive and speedily cleared the
deck with the muskets that were there. All the rest of the
day the natives kept off. The ship's clerk, Lewis, was one of
the first struck, and he had fallen down the hatchway with a
serious wound. He recovered sufficiently to discuss the situation
with the four other survivors. The latter would not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
attempt to sail the ship, as they thought they could not get
her out of the bay, so they put off in the night in one of the
boats. Lewis, it is said, declined to go on account of his
wound, thinking he would die soon anyhow. He therefore
made a plan for revenge. He arranged the powder so that he
could instantly explode it, and when the fair morning sun
again shone on the bay he stood on the deck and beckoned to
some natives to come aboard. As he was the only one to be
seen, they finally climbed up the <i>Tonquin's</i> sides. The decks
were presently again thickly crowded, all eager to secure the
rich prizes. At this moment Lewis executed his intention.
The waters of the bay were strewn with wreckage intermingled
with dead and dying. A hundred or more were annihilated
and another grewsome tale was added to the long list describing
the intercourse between the opposing factions for the
mastery of the Wilderness. The four men were prevented
from leaving the bay by stress of weather, and took refuge in
a cove for shelter, where they were captured and taken back
to the village. They were sacrificed with every cruelty known
to the enraged natives. Thus ended the first trading venture
of the Pacific Fur Company.
</p>

<p>
Before the <i>Tonquin</i> left Astoria, the party arrived from the
upper Columbia under command of David Thompson of the
North-west Company,—the expedition designed to forestall
the American settlement at this point, but it was a little too
late. Thompson had accomplished the first descent of the
Columbia above Snake River. He was well received by his
compatriots, especially by McDougall, who was in charge
pending Hunt's arrival. McDougall did not conceal his devotion
to the British Crown, and it was this which so exasperated
Captain Thorn. Thompson finally left, returning
by the road he had come. He was astronomer and geographer
of the North-west Company, and made notes that are of great
value.<a name='FA_77' id='FA_77' href='#FN_77' class='fnanchor'>[77]</a>

</div>

<p>
Meanwhile Hunt was bravely setting in motion a second
train of disasters. With Donald McKenzie, another of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
foreign partners, he went in June, 1810, to Montreal, the
great fur-trading centre, and secured canoes and <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i> for
the overland journey. The party proceeded by way of the
Ottawa River, Mackinaw, Green Bay, Fox River, the Wisconsin,
and the Mississippi to St. Louis, the route that had been
the first from the east into the Mississippi Wilderness, and
which had been a highway ever since. Lisa's Missouri Fur
Company was at this time fitting out an expedition to go in
search of Henry, who, as already mentioned, had been driven
from his station at the forks of the Missouri, and Lisa was in
doubt as to his whereabouts. The Spaniard looked with disfavour
on the new rival, but this was no more than all the fur
traders were in the habit of doing. He did what he could to
check the enterprise without open hostility, but Hunt's plans
progressed, nevertheless, and he soon had his affairs in order.
Bradbury, an English naturalist, had been for some time
making St. Louis headquarters, and was desirous of going up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
the Missouri for specimens. Hunt at once cordially invited
him and another English naturalist, Nuttall, to accompany
him as far as they wished to go. Bradbury afterwards wrote
the book which is now so well known, and which throws a
valuable side-light on the starting of Hunt's party. He also
tells much about the natives, of whom he remarks, "No people
on earth discharge the duties of hospitality with more cordial
good-will."
</p>

<p>
On the 21st of October, 1810, Hunt left St. Louis with the
intention of wintering not far up the river, and in the spring
following the trail of Lewis and Clark to the mouth of the
Columbia. He had three boats, two being barges, and the
third a "keel" boat. The winter camp was made at the mouth
of the Nadowa, where several new men joined the ranks, notwithstanding
that it was considered a rather desperate venture.
About the end of April, 1811, all being ready, the party
started up the muddy Missouri with four boats, one of which
mounted a swivel and two howitzers. The number of persons
in the company now amounted to sixty, almost too many for
success. Forty of these were Canadian <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i>, who, while
exceedingly useful in their sphere of boatmen, were not so
serviceable away from their craft, just as a good sailor is out
of his element on horseback. But in those days no fur trader
thought of travelling without them, and the North-west and
Hudson Bay Companies employed them by hundreds. The
rivers west of the Rocky Mountains, however, were entirely
different from those flowing from the eastern slopes. Had
Hunt been aware of this, he would have sent his forty <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i>
back, before crossing the mountains, where their peculiar abilities
were of less advantage. Indeed, had it not been for the
idea of utilising them, it is likely that the story of this traverse
would have been less painful.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Little trouble was experienced from natives, although the
latter had now been shot and cheated for a sufficient time to
render them dangerous. Alexander Carson, now with Hunt,
was the man who had shot a Sioux not long before, just to try
his skill. Some tribes, too, wished to injure others by preventing
traders from reaching them, thus compelling manufactured
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
articles to pass through their own hands, whereby they made a
profit. This was a cause of some difficulty. In addition, the
rival fur companies used means, honourable and dishonourable,
to injure each other, and they sometimes had serious battles.
They would also incite against newcomers natives with whom
they had traded, and this was a frequent source of disaster.
Two men with Hunt, Ramsay Crooks and McClellan, believed
that Lisa in this way had induced the Sioux a couple of years
before, to thwart their plans, and McClellan was still incensed
to such a degree that he declared he would shoot Lisa on sight.
As the latter diplomatic gentleman was also bound up the river
a few days behind Hunt, and had sent word that he would like
to travel with him to strengthen both parties, the outlook was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
precarious. The whole party were suspicious of Lisa's motives,
and Hunt endeavoured to keep in advance. His chief interpreter,
Pierre Dorion, a son of the Dorion who had gone with
Lewis and Clark for a time, had been in Lisa's employ, and
there was a fierce disagreement between them as to certain
large amounts of whiskey which Dorion had imbibed, and which
Lisa had modestly charged against him at ten dollars a quart.
The Spaniard had a barge manned by twenty expert boatmen,
and he knew the river. It was therefore only a few days
before he overtook the Hunt party. With him was Henry
Brackenridge, who later wrote a valuable book, and this man
with Bradbury and Nuttall laboured as peace preservers, and
though Dorion and Lisa had a dramatic scene, with McClellan
ever ready to exterminate the perfidious Lisa on the spot,
there was no bloodshed. To make matters worse, Lisa used
towards Hunt an expression that roused his ire, so that for a
day or two the rival crews barely spoke. At last, however,
the Hunt people decided that Lisa was bent on no immediate
mischief, and amicable relations were established.
</p>

<p>
Arriving at an Arikara village, some distance below the
Mandan towns, Hunt began preparations to leave the river
and strike across the country, thus abandoning the trail of
Lewis and Clark. He was induced to take this step by three
trappers he had met and employed, Robinson, Hoback, and
Rizner, who had been in the country at the head of the Missouri.
The change was a good one, and had Hunt dispensed
with the <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i> at this point, he would have clung to his
horses all the way, which would have saved much time and
suffering, but he took the boatmen along, though he exchanged
the boats with Lisa for horses, of which the latter had a supply
at his fort at the Mandan towns. Thither Crooks and
Bradbury went to bring them down. Meanwhile the <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i>
fraternised with the Arikaras and were particularly devoted to
the women, whose temporary favours were readily purchased.
Bradbury says: "Travellers who have been acquainted with
savages have remarked that they are either very liberal of
their women to strangers or extremely jealous. In this species
of liberality no nation can be exceeded by the Arikaras, who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
flocked down every evening with their wives, sisters, and
daughters, each anxious to meet with a market for them."
And yet if a white man adopted regular relations they expected
him to continue them, and not abandon his wife as was
so often done. Their code was a peculiar one.

Bradbury and Nuttall here left the Hunt party and returned,
while on the 18th of July, 1811, the Astorians, having
also said good-bye to Lisa, who had been of more service than
detriment, turned their faces toward the Backbone of the
Continent. A man named Rose was engaged, with the expectation
that he would be serviceable in the Crow country,
as he had been a good deal with that tribe, but Hunt discovered
indications of treachery, and was glad on reaching the
Crows to pay Rose off and let him depart. Crossing the Black
Hills, and the Bighorn Mountains, they kept up the Bighorn
to Wind River, and on the 14th of September camped at a
place where a large fork came down from the Wind River
Mountains. It will be noticed that mountains and streams
were already named, showing that white men had frequently
been in this region. In fact, the trappers with Hunt knew it
pretty well, and told him that if he followed up Wind River
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
and crossed a single mountain range he would be on the headwaters
of the Columbia, but game being scarce, he decided to
go to another stream which they said flowed to the south of
west beyond the Wind River range. This was Spanish River,
now the Green, the upper continuation of the Colorado. They
found a beaten trail leading that way and followed it over
some very high ground whence the trappers pointed out the
Three Tetons. These magnificent peaks Hunt called the
Pilot Knobs! They were hailed with joy, for they marked
the end of the first stage of the journey, but had the party
been able to look ahead their joy would have collapsed in tears.
Descending into Green River Valley, afterwards famous as the
place of rendezvous for trappers, they found it delightful, with
grassy glades and plenty of buffalo, as well as other game.
</p>

<p>
This was a crucial point for Hunt. Had he decided to
stick to his horses till he was sure of the navigation, the party
would have escaped much misery, but instead of camping here,
amidst plenty of game, till the path could be reconnoitred, he
stopped only five days to lay in a supply of buffalo meat and
then went on. Winter with rapid strides was approaching,
yet they would have gained time by tarrying here, with scouts
thrown ahead. But they moved without knowing what to
expect. Hoback had been on the headwaters of the Snake
and he led them by way of a small stream they called Hoback's
River to a large branch. This, because of its rapid and fierce
current, was named Mad River. The <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i> were tired
enough of horses, and were eager to sail down on this impetuous
tide, so, without even scouting beforehand, trees were
felled to make canoes. Several men were then sent down the
stream, but before they returned two Snakes came along and
informed them that navigation was impossible. When the
men came back they gave the same report. Here was a
chance to find out much concerning the region before them,
but no attempt seems to have been made. Robinson, Hoback,
and Rizner, who had been with Henry, of the Missouri Company,
now advised going to Henry's post, to which the Snakes
were quite willing to guide them. After four days' travel
they reached it amid a flurry of snow.

<p>
Henry had gone, but they were glad to occupy the deserted
cabins. The stream they were now on was large and
swift, probably the main Snake River, and the fatal canoe idea
cropped up again.<a name='FA_78' id='FA_78' href='#FN_78' class='fnanchor'>[78]</a> Timber was felled and boats soon completed.
One advantage of travelling with horses Hunt seems
now to have lost sight of: they can always be consumed as
food. But Hunt decided to leave them here, and to establish
the first of the trading-posts. The two Snakes were hired to
look after their welfare. Four trappers had been dropped to
begin work on Mad River, and now five more were left at this
place to go into the mountains.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen canoes having been completed, the expedition
pushed off on October 16th, and swept rapidly down the
stream all unknown. For some fifty miles affairs went well.
Then the river began to plunge among rocks, two canoes were
swamped, one of them smashed, and a large portion of the
cargoes swept away. They continued with great labour, and
on the 28th met with a sad disaster. The canoe of Ramsay
Crooks struck a rock in one of the rapids and was capsized.
Four men, including Crooks, managed to save themselves, but
the fifth, Clappine, an expert <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageur</span></i>, was dashed away in
the torrent and lost. This was at the beginning of a very bad
stretch of river, hemmed in for miles by high cliffs of several
hundred feet, so foaming and torrential that they named it
the Caldron Linn. The country was excessively barren. The
provisions had dwindled to no more than five days' supply.
The situation was desperate. In these straits it was decided
to split up into small parties, which should set out in different
directions, the idea being that it would be easier thus to obtain
subsistence. One party went down the river, Crooks with
five others started back toward Fort Henry to get the horses,
and another under McKenzie went north.

<p>
With Hunt there remained thirty-four persons, three being
Dorion's squaw and her two children, aged two and four.
Like Sacajawea, on the Lewis and Clark expedition, she was a
sturdy and uncomplaining traveller, resourceful and resolute.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
The goods were cached at Caldron Linn, which consumed three
days, and then Crooks and his men came back discouraged
about reaching the place where the horses had been left.
Without these, and with no chance of using the river, progress
toward the mouth of the Columbia would be slow. They
were not only breaking the Wilderness, but they were doing
it in the hardest possible way. Hunt followed the stream for
a time and then on the advice of some natives he led the party
across the desert country to the northward. As one to-day,
even under favourable circumstances, rides over the wide waste
of lava-covered plain lying north of the Snake, he cannot fail
to be impressed by the sweep of giant snowy ranges that encircle
the horizon. To Hunt, these gleaming barriers must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
have presented a deeply sinister aspect. His party was on the
verge of starvation, when they arrived at a little river where
there was a Shoshone camp. Here some fish and a couple of
dogs were bought, enough to give them a supper. They also
secured a couple of horses, and then went on. At last they
tried to leave the river, but returned to it again after severe
climbing through deep snow, and next day met Crooks and
his men on the point of starvation coming up stream. Hunt
had traded for a couple more horses with some Shoshones, and
one of these he now killed, making a hasty canoe out of the
skin with which to send Crooks some of the meat. Crooks
came over in the boat, and reported that his party had been
reduced to some soles of old moccasins for food. Hunt now
decided to go back up the river in search of a Snake camp,
where they might barter for more horses and dogs, but a new
difficulty appeared. Crooks and one other were so feeble
they could not travel. The party wished to leave them but
Hunt refused to do this. Five stayed with him and the rest
left. The stock of provisions finally dwindled to three beaver
skins, and taking one of these Hunt at last pushed on to overtake
those who had gone in order that he might persuade
Dorion, who now had the only horse, a bony creature, to
sacrifice it for the benefit of Crooks. But Dorion pleaded for
the animal and they went ahead a little farther, when they
surprised a Snake camp, where a number of horses were grazing.
The natives ran, and the whites seized five of the horses
and soon were devouring one, while a messenger was hurried
back to Crooks with some of the meat on another.
</p>

<p>
Some of Crooks's party were across the river in a starving
condition and could see and hear distinctly. When Crooks
came he sent meat over to them, and one <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageur</span></i> jumped
wildly into the frail skin canoe to return. When he came near
the shore, the sight of the roasting meat caused him to deliriously
clap his hands and dance, which operation upset the canoe
and the poor fellow disappeared in the furious current. The
boatman was saved with difficulty. John Day, who had been
one of the strongest, was now a mere skeleton, barely able to
walk, and all were extremely emaciated. About December
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213' href='#Page_213'>213</a></span>
15th, they arrived at a little creek which they had crossed on
the 26th of November, and here discovered a dozen Shoshone
lodges, and on up the stream were more. Hunt traded for a
couple of horses, a dog, and some dried fish and roots. From
these natives he tried to secure a guide, but they urged him to
remain with them, though at last one consented to go for
large pay.
</p>

<p>
On December 21st they went down the creek to Snake
River, and down this a short distance in search of some rafts.
These were not found and two horses were killed to make a
canoe out of their skins. The river was full of floating ice,
and the frail canoe gave them much trouble, but on December
23d, breaking the shore ice, they succeeded in crossing.
Crooks's party were waiting for them, and they all moved forward
together, under the guidance of the native and two of his
companions. The <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i> were happy to say farewell to
this perilous stream, so unlike any they had ever seen before.
</p>

<p>
The ground was snow covered, the weather stormy, but
fortified by a meal of horse meat once in twenty-four hours,
they moved on toward the Blue Mountains, a superb range
which one sees well from the railway now crossing the north-east
corner of Oregon about on the trail that Hunt was following.
On the 29th, Pierre Dorion was made a father, and
his squaw had three children in place of the two she had thus
far dragged through all the difficulties. Dorion's horse now
came into full service for the transportation of this increased
family. One of the <i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i>, La Bonte, here gave out, and
had to take to another horse which had been packed, Hunt
himself carrying the load. This La Bonte seems to be the
same that Ruxton<a name='FA_79' id='FA_79' href='#FN_79' class='fnanchor'>[79]</a> afterwards wrote about. On the last day
of the year they came to a wide valley without snow and here
camped for New Year's Day, 1812, and as much revelry as
possible was indulged in. Some Shoshone tipis being nearby,
they did not lack for dog and horse steaks, and began to feel
in better mood. They finally crossed the Blue Mountains
and descended into the valley of the Umatilla, where there
was no snow, and the weather was mild, for they were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
approaching sea level. Dorion's infant now died, but there was
no halt on this account. All pressed on, encouraged by sights
of deer and of horse tracks, till they came to a large camp of
Sciatogas, or Tushepaws, where there was plenty of everything
they needed, with at least two thousand horses grazing
on the hills. Hunt was now but two days' march from the
Columbia. Horses were cheap and the men ate their fill,
though these Amerinds did not eat horses or dogs. Proceeding
they came at last to the Columbia, having occupied six
months in traversing the Wilderness from the Arikara village.
Had they stuck to their horses, they might have done it in
four. Part of this wide stretch had been entirely unknown to
white men, and Hunt's expedition, therefore, as an American
exploration, ranks second to that of Lewis and Clark, while in
its bearing on the future of that great unclaimed region then
known as Oregon, it stands on an equal footing. It was also
the third traverse of the North American continent above
Mexico; and it was the beginning of the Oregon Trail.
</p>

<p>
Keeping down the north bank they began to hear news of
the Astoria establishment, and then of the loss of the <i>Tonquin</i>.
The people by the way were well posted on these matters,
although they had no newspaper. Purchasing canoes, the
Hunt party ran down on the current, and on February 15,
1812, they came in sight of Astoria, the goal they had so long
and so strenuously struggled to reach. McKenzie was already
there, having beaten Hunt by a full month. All the chief
men of the party, except Crooks, were now once more together.
It therefore seemed that the Astoria enterprise was about to
bloom into success, but more trouble was in store for it.

<p>
The Astoria establishment was now in good order. There
seemed to be no reason why Astor's project at last should
not move on to success. Several trading-posts were founded
in the upper Columbia valley, and to further develop the
situation, Hunt, in the supply ship <i>Beaver</i>, which had duly
arrived in May, 1812, sailed north along the coast. This was
in accordance with another part of the plan whereby arrangements
had been made with the Russians for supplying their
North American trading posts with merchandise and transporting
their peltry. The chief of the Russian company was
the famous Baranof, a man of domineering power and iron
purpose. His home was in the celebrated Baranof Castle, at
New Archangel, now Sitka, a castle that saw grog flow like
water, and where a teetotaler met with no toleration. The
castle, a massive log structure, was accidentally burned only a
few years ago. Hunt withstood as well as he could the power
of Baranof's potations, and succeeded in adjusting his business
satisfactorily.
</p>

<p>
Before he left Astoria, he sent Robert Stuart, a young
Scotchman of integrity, good judgment, and sincere devotion
to the company, back overland on June 29th, with messages
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
for Astor, and this journey deserves more space than it is possible
to give it here, for Stuart traversed new ground a part of
the way, and so may be recorded among the first Wilderness
breakers.<a name='FA_80' id='FA_80' href='#FN_80' class='fnanchor'>[80]</a> With him went McClellan, Ramsay Crooks, John
Day, Ben Jones, Andri Vallar, and Francis Le Clerc. Crooks
and John Day, after having reluctantly been left behind by
Hunt, had finally arrived at Astoria in a desperate condition,
from which Crooks recovered, but Day's health was permanently
destroyed and, his mind giving way, Stuart was obliged
to send him back to Astoria, where he died the next year.
His memory endures in the name of a river in Idaho, as well
as in his connection with the second great traverse of the
continent within the limits of the United States. The Stuart
party on its eastward way followed the Columbia and the
Snake, meeting opposition from some natives and assistance
from others. They also encountered near the head of the
Snake some of the hunters who had been left to trap and trade.
These men were in a sorry plight, having met with various
disasters and also with robbery at the hands of hostile bands
of natives. At Caldron Linn they found that six of the
caches had been robbed by natives under the guidance of three
<i><span lang="fr_FR">voyageurs</span></i> of the Hunt party who had remained behind and
finally had taken up their residence among some Shoshones.
Fitting out several of the men from the three remaining
caches, Stuart left them to once more try their fortunes, and
directed his course on to the East. After a good deal of difficulty,
the 17th of October found him crossing one of the
branches of the Green. Food was limited, and finding no
buffalo here the men were at the last notch. Francis Le Clerc
insisted that lots should be cast, as it was better for one to die
than for all, but Stuart threatened to shoot him on the spot
for the suggestion. Food was soon after obtained and the
party saved from extinction.

<p>
Crossing over to the head of the North Platte, which they
did not know at the time, they descended its wide valley for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
a long distance, and then made a permanent camp for the
winter, November 2d, where there was abundant game. A
visit from a war party of Arapahos caused them to abandon
the place and seek another, where the remainder of the winter
was passed comfortably without interruption, and in the early
spring they continued down the Platte, meeting in April with
an Otoe who told them of the war between the United States
and Great Britain. Within a few miles of the Missouri they
bought a canoe from a trader and then sailed down, arriving
at St. Louis April 30th, 1813, ten months after their departure
from Astoria. Their horses had all been stolen on the way by
the natives, which not only caused delay, but deprived them
of a permanent food supply, and was one cause of their descent
to the brink of collapse.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the news of the war reached the North-west
Company, orders were issued for a party to proceed to Astoria
to oust the Americans. This detachment under McTavish and
La Roque reached the place in a famishing condition, but as
McDougall, one of their countrymen, was in charge, Hunt
being absent, they were cordially received. For various reasons
Hunt's return was delayed, the next annual supply ship,
the <i>Lark</i>, failed to come, having been wrecked on the way,
and altogether the project was again deeply overshadowed.
McDougall negotiated a sale with the North-west representatives,
and when the British man-of-war <i>Raccoon</i>, on December
1, 1813, arrived to capture the American post, all the disgusted
captain could do was to substitute the British for the American
flag, as, of course, he had no power to molest property of the
North-west Company. He re-named the place Fort George,
and sailed away, without the rich prize money he had anticipated.
When Hunt, who had been back and again gone off
to secure a ship for the removal of his company's property,
once more arrived on February 28, 1814, he found the place
a North-west Company post with McDougall in charge. He
accepted drafts on Montreal for the settlement of the account
of the Pacific Fur Company, and this part of the War of 1812
was thus a purely business transaction. It would be cheaper
if all wars could be settled on the same basis.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
</p>

<p>
McDougall has been roundly denounced for selling out in
this manner. Astor himself considered it disgraceful. But it
is probable that in the end, this procedure was the best, and
there is nothing to indicate that McDougall acted in bad faith.
The Astoria enterprise was ended. It had been well planned,
but circumstances were against it. It did not expire in a blaze
of glory to make the close romantic, but merged into the
North-west Company as one day melts into another, and for
years thereafter this company was the dominant power of the
whole region. But while the scheme as a fur-trading venture
had failed, as a part of the history of breaking the Wilderness
it takes a front place. Had those in authority then fully appreciated
the importance of the proceedings of the Pacific Fur
Company to the future of the United States, they would have
bent their energies to its successful promotion instead of taking
but a languid interest. Nevertheless the bearing of the
disastrous operations of the Pacific Fur Company on the
boundary of Louisiana and the claims of the United States in
the Oregon country was of the first importance.
</p>

<p>
When the treaty concluding the war was signed, December
24, 1814, it stipulated that all territory and all places taken
from either party, with a few exceptions, were to be restored,
and on this basis, though the Oregon country was not mentioned,
the United States claimed Astoria. But the British,
while finally agreeing to yield the post, although they claimed
it had never been booty of war, refused to allow any right of
possession of the region to go with it, asserting that Astoria
had merely been established in British territory. Captain Biddle
in the United States ship <i>Ontario</i> took formal possession
August 9, 1818, and somewhat later J. B. Prevost went there
on the British ship <i>Blossom</i> and received the actual transfer as
agent for the United States. Great Britain was firm in its
claim for the mouth of the Columbia and as no settlement
could be reached it was agreed, October 20, 1818, that for a
period of ten years the whole region eastward to the Rocky
Mountains should remain free and open to both nations. East
of the Rocky Mountains the forty-ninth parallel was at the
same time adopted as the division between Louisiana and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
British territory, an adjustment which had nearly been arrived
at eleven years earlier.

</div>

<p>
The Spaniards now once more came forward with their
claim to all Pacific territory up to the fifty-fifth degree, while
Russia demanded
everything down to the
fifty-first. The United
States yielded nothing
in this direction, and,
still claiming Texas to
the Rio Grande as a
part of the Louisiana
Purchase, was finally
able, in February, 1819,
to negotiate a treaty
with Spain whereby
that country ceded
Florida, and its rights
north of latitude forty-two,
in the Oregon region,
for the claims of
the United States to
Texas. Spain desired
to extend its boundary
to the Mississippi, but
in this did not succeed.
The line between all
Spanish territory and
Louisiana was also
definitely fixed, and the
Louisiana Purchase
now had limits for the
first time, except on the west between the forty-second parallel
and the forty-ninth, and no line could be drawn here till
the United States and Great Britain settled their difference
over the Oregon region. These various agreements delimited
Louisiana as it is usually given on maps, except north from
the forty-second parallel, where there never was a boundary,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
except that the Rocky Mountains were temporarily recognised
as the eastern limit of the disputed region. The lines of
Louisiana on the west followed the Sabine River to latitude
thirty-two, thence north to Red River and west along it to
the one hundredth meridian, thence north on this to the Arkansas,
and west on the Arkansas to its source, thence due
north to the forty-second parallel. See <a href="#i-183">map on page 154</a>,
in which the dotted part shows the original state of the claims.
All north of the forty-second parallel claimed by Spain fell to
the United States. These claims in themselves were not very
strong, except as to original discovery on the coast, but, united
to those acquired from France, from Gray's discovery, from
Lewis and Clark's exploration, from the Astoria establishment
and its subsidiary posts, and from the journey of Wilson Price
Hunt, they presented a better title to the region than any
other nation could show.
</p>

<p>
Pike had reported the country he traversed to be no more
than a barren desert, and it was his opinion that it would be a
permanent and an effectual barrier to the western movement
of the Americans. This discouraging view, together with the
War of 1812, retarded for several years operations in the Wilderness
on the part of Americans. The British companies, however,
were constantly active, the North-west holding all the
country west of the Rocky Mountains and a large part east
of them. Trappers operated along the Missouri and its tributaries,
some few entered the mountains, and the energetic Lisa
was particularly active in pushing his trade. In 1813 he was
made sub-agent for all tribes on the Missouri above the Kansas
River, with instructions to prevent them from going over to
the British. He seems to have been a useful man in many
ways, and Brackenridge, who was with him for a considerable
time, has given a glowing picture of his enterprise and bold
energy. He made his last voyage in 1820, and died August
12th within the limits of the present St. Louis.
</p>

<p>
In order to gain further knowledge of the vast western
possessions, another expedition was sent out by the Government
in 1819 under Major Long, to go to the Rocky Mountains
by way of the Platte and return by Red River. This

party left St. Louis on June 21st, with the advantage of a
steamboat.<a name='FA_81' id='FA_81' href='#FN_81' class='fnanchor'>[81]</a> Fulton's experiments having achieved success in
1807, steam propulsion had been extensively introduced for
river navigation and had brought a great change in transportation
facilities. Long's steamer, the <i>Western Engineer</i>, proved
to be even better than was expected, and they made their way
up the Missouri easily against the strong current, where by
the old method of towing the keel boats, enormous labour was
involved. It was also a source of great interest to the natives.
The region was rapidly settling along the Missouri east of the
mouth of the Kansas so that supplies were there much easier
to obtain than formerly, and altogether the new order of things
made progress for Major Long quicker than that of any of his
predecessors. By September 17th, he had arrived at Fort Lisa
and went into winter quarters near Council Bluffs, naming the
place Engineer Cantonment. Long, himself, went East again
from here by way of St. Louis, returning on the 28th of May,
1820. Lieutenant Graham then took the steamboat back, while
Long mounted his party on horses for the trip across the
plains. There were twenty-eight horses and mules, one for
each man, and eight for carrying packs. The absurdity of
having only eight pack animals for a party of twenty men
starting on a long exploring tour far from any base of supplies,
seems not to have struck any of the party, not even Major
Long. It was the same old story over again, inadequate
preparation, a story, too, that was often to be repeated in the
future. For such a party there should have been no fewer
than twenty pack animals, and thirty would have been nearer
the right number. The list of supplies was equally absurd.
There was no flour, and only five hundred pounds of biscuit,
one hundred and fifty pounds of pork, and three bushels of
parched cornmeal, twenty-five pounds of coffee, and thirty of
sugar.

<p>
They left Engineer Cantonment on June 6, 1820. The
chief members of the party were, besides Major Long, Captain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
J. R. Bell, T. Say, and Dr. Edwin James,<a name='FA_82' id='FA_82' href='#FN_82' class='fnanchor'>[82]</a> the last afterwards
writing the account of the journey from the note-books of the
leading members, and at one place mentioning the inadequate
outfit. They were well received at a village of the Pawnees,
and the chief said, "You must have long hearts to undertake
such a journey with so weak a force, hearts that would reach
from the earth to the heavens." He urged them not to go
on, but of course no heed was paid to this. They passed
other Pawnee villages along the Platte, and went up the Loup
Fork, to the Grand Pawnee village, then across from the Loup
Fork to the main Platte again, and followed that stream up to
the junction of its two great branches. Here they chose the
south branch, and on the 30th of June had their first glimpse
of the mountains lying like clouds on the horizon and gradually
developing till their snowy summits were plainly seen,
especially a prominent peak since named after Long. This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
first view of the great range is always thrilling, and as one
sights the heavy masses lying so mysteriously soft in the clear
light, he remembers the exclamation of the good bishop, who
as he stepped in this region off a railway train, deeply breathed
the sparkling air and fervently cried, "Well! I have never been
out-of-doors before!"
</p>

<p>
They had expected to celebrate the Fourth of July on some
cool summit, but on that day the peaks were still far distant
and they were forced to content themselves with an extra pint
of maize and a small portion of whiskey, on the common plain.
Provisions were alternately scarce and plenty according to
locality and the success of the hunters; sometimes buffalo
hump-ribs, tongues, and marrow bones were abundant; again
there was starvation diet. At last, on the 10th, they were
before the great Backbone, with Pike's "highest peak" in full
view from a hill. On the 12th they camped on the Fontaine
qui Bouille near the present site of Colorado City, and Dr.
James, with four men started out to climb the great peak.
Two of the men were left at the base to care for the horses,
while the others went on. About noon they came to the
Boiling Spring, the present well-known soda spring of Manitou,
which gives name to the stream of which it forms a source.<a name='FA_83' id='FA_83' href='#FN_83' class='fnanchor'>[83]</a>
This beautiful spring was of great interest to James and they
had their lunch beside it. Through its crystal waters could be
seen on the bottom the offerings of beads and trinkets by the
Amerinds.
</p>

<p>
Before this no attempt to climb the mountain had ever
been successful, but as in many other similar matters, no serious
effort seems ever before to have been made. The night of the
13th, James and his two companions spent in a most uncomfortable
place, and on the next morning started early with
the hope of making the round journey before dark. About
noon, timber line, 11,720 feet, was reached, and by four
o'clock they stood on the mighty summit, 14,108 feet above
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
the sea, and 8000 above the plains, and could see on the
east the prairie ocean melting into the limitless distance,
while on the other hand spread away a broad chaos of
peaks, canyons, valleys, fading into the depths of the unknown
Wilderness. Vast clouds of grasshoppers were flying
over the peak, sometimes so dense as almost to obscure the
light. After about half an hour on the majestic summit, now
reached by a prosaic railway, the descent began. Losing their
course, they failed to reach the camp of the previous night,
and were forced to sleep out with no food or shelter or comfort
of any kind; not after all so awful as it sounds. As soon
as light came in the morning they continued, and reached their
camp only to find it ablaze; the fire had spread and consumed
everything except a few scraps of food, on which they greedily
breakfasted. A heavy bison and Amerind trail passed the
Boiling Spring going into the mountains. This is now a road
to South Park.
</p>

<p>
Long rightly named this peak after James, and it should
have retained the name of the man first to surmount it, but
geographical names are sometimes singularly acquired, and so
the peak which Pike saw from some miles away, and was not
the first to see, received his name without his intention, or that
of any one else. Indeed, no one can tell just how it came to
be called after Pike, except that it simply grew; and Frémont
finally put it on record.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Boiling Spring Creek, as the Long party called it,
translating the original French name, they struck south-west
on July 16th, to the "Arkansa," thus properly pronouncing
(Arkansaw), and also correctly writing it. The river takes its
name from the Arkansa tribe, and how it came to be designated
by the plural is another of the curiosities of geographic
nomenclature. They looked for Pike's "blockhouse," but
could not find a trace of anything resembling work of white
men, which is not strange when we remember that what Pike
built on or near the site of Pueblo, was an extremely rude
affair and not a house at all. Some of the Long party went
up the river to the deep canyon by which it cuts a passage
through the mountains, where Pike had already been, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
where to-day the railway follows the torrent out of the tangled
rock masses to the plain.
</p>

<p>
On July 19th they turned east down the Arkansas. Two
parties were then formed. One under Bell was to explore the
Arkansas to Fort Smith, and there await the others, who
under Long's own command were to travel south in search of
the sources of Red River, with the intention of descending
that stream. Their guide all the time had been Joseph Bijeau,
who knew the country between the Arkansas and the Platte
perfectly, but that below the Arkansas he was not familiar
with. He had often been in the Rocky Mountains for some
distance and gave a description of the region, so far as he knew
it, which was correct.
</p>

<p>
On the 24th of July the parties separated. The thermometer
stood at 100° in the shade, when there was any, and
the water being either bad or lacking entirely, the journey
south from the Arkansas was not exhilarating. Wood was also
scarce or absent, and fires had to be made of "buffalo chips."
They then followed up the Purgatoire and finally passed to the
head of another stream which they concluded must be Red
River. They crossed more than twenty well-beaten parallel
trails, and though they did not know it then, they were within
a few miles of the Metropolis of the Far Wilderness, Santa
Fé, and could easily have gone there by this road, had they
so desired. There was suffering for food, but from time to
time this was relieved by the killing of a wild horse, a buffalo,
or some other game. On August 9th they met a large band
of "Kaskaias," who, while not exactly hostile, were not hospitable,
and it was with difficulty that any food was obtained
from them. Water they carried in paunches of bison, and in
camp hung them on tripods. Long did not discover from
these people, strangely enough, that the river he was following
was not Red River, as he supposed, but the Canadian,
and it was not till they had consumed seven weeks and
travelled down the valley of the stream 796 miles, that on
September 10th they came to the Arkansas and learned their
error. Two days later they met a trader, Robert Glen, the
first white man seen since the 6th of the preceding June. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
gave them coffee, biscuit, and some other supplies, and told of
the safe arrival at Fort Smith of the other division of the expedition.
Fort Smith, which they soon reached, was on the
Arkansas just below the Poteau, and had been established by
Major Long in 1817.
He was now again
on familiar ground,
and nothing of note
remains to be mentioned
concerning his
expedition.
</p>

<p>
Red River seemed
to evade the American
explorer. Pike
had failed to find it;
Long now had a
similar disappointment,
due to the
same cause as Pike's,
neglect to reconnoitre
properly before
proceeding; and
in 1806 Captain
Sparks, attempting
to explore westward
from its mouth, met
with a greatly superior
Spanish force
and was compelled
to retire.

<p>
From the Arkansas
to the northern
border of the United States the country was now fairly understood,
the Columbia was no longer a mystery, Garces and
other Spaniards had traversed Arizona, New Mexico had long
been flourishing, the California Missions were quietly growing
rich, and the unbroken Wilderness was narrowing approximately
to the region between the thirty-sixth and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
forty-second parallels and the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky
Mountains. Not that all outside of these bounds was well
known, for it was far from it, but it could no longer be regarded
as Wilderness absolute, while the area above outlined,
except for the entrada of Escalante, was a blank. It was all
the property of Spain, hence Americans had no right to
enter, but when the War of 1812 was well disposed of
hunters began again to pour into the Wilderness, and Long's
expedition seemed to mark the beginning of another important
attack upon the mountain fastnesses, where the
beaver by thousands and tens of thousands were enjoying a
busy life and holding forth unwittingly an alluring bait that
was now to induce a great invasion of Spanish territory
notwithstanding the challenge of the sentinel. Spain's hold,
too, on her Mexican possessions was loosening. Iturbide
in 1821 proclaimed Mexican independence, and the next year
Santa Aña unfurled the flag of the Republic. For some time
Mexico had her full attention occupied with internal affairs.

As the third decade of the nineteenth century came in, the
trappers and traders began more than ever to long for
the conquest of the great mountain Wilderness, whose solemn
front, ending the wide rolling plain, reared its craggy barriers
with soothing outlines tantalisingly suggestive of wealth and
wonder easily accessible behind. The hardships of the explorers
to the mouth of the Columbia passed unheeded, for
the men who now came to match nerve and muscle against
the entrenched mystery were in their natural element when
battling with danger and difficulty in the uplifting air, and,
like the eagle sailing high, were never more at home than
when pushing their daring tread into some virgin valley, where
falling waters broke the calm and fostered multitudes of
beaver, where game bounded from every nook and glade,
and the rich bunch-grass fattened their patient horses. Here
with traps, a good rifle, and plenty of ammunition, notwithstanding
encounters with the native striving to preserve his
happy hunting-grounds, their lives were full of pleasure and
that resolute and healthy vigour which comes to the intelligent
man alert to protect life and limb. They appeared to have
been born for this particular operation of breaking the final
strongholds of the Wilderness.

<p>
The whole western region, being at a greater elevation than
two thousand feet, the air is extremely invigorating. This desirable
quality, with the absence of continuous rains from the
larger part, renders it an ideal country for living in the open.
Even in dead of winter the dry air causes the cold to be more
easily borne than the same degree in moister regions. Those
who have never tried it can hardly appreciate the pleasure of
winter living out-of-doors; nor can they realise the alluring
interest of unknown country, where now and then from some
splendid height the wide encircling problem is viewed for
leagues, or till merged in the haze of distant sky. Perchance
a film of smoke steals up from some blue, deep glen to mark
the presence of dwellers in the wilds. Toward evening the
night mists draw earth and sky together, and the mountain
billows seem interminable and impossible. Another sun lights
the mystery, and the stranger gropes on expecting surprises at
every step.

<p>
The extreme hardship that sometimes was endured was
frequently due to wrong decisions or inadequate outfit; or
from going ahead too fast. The born mountaineer and explorer,
however, meets with few setbacks because he does not
know a setback when he sees it. He fits into the Wilderness
without effort, and drifts across it as summer clouds cleave a
tranquil sky. Many of the American trappers of this period
had been reared to life in the woods of the East; the rifle was
their childhood's toy. Through sheer love of adventure they
were impelled to the wider Wilderness, and quickly adjusted
themselves to new conditions. They could have been anywhere
readily distinguished. With compact muscles and solid
frame, partners of fresh air, exercise, and simple fare, they had
a clear, wide gaze, flinching before neither man nor beast; and
unfailing nerve that often whipped prospective disaster to
success.
</p>

<p>
The routine of the frontier and especially of the deeper
Wilderness precluded any great lapse from physical excellence.
When a man was alive he was generally well. Indeed, the
average American trapper had a constitution that seemed invincible.
Besides this his moral fibre was usually excellent.
His word was good, his dealings with his fellows honourable.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
Money he cared less for than freedom. Cheerfully he risked
his life for another. The code of law was unwritten, but it
was well understood; punishment for serious offences was
swift and certain. Crimes against white men were proportionately
less than in a modern city; but when it came to dealings
and intercourse with the Amerind conscience was paralysed.
They also rated his blood at about the price of water, and out
of this, for them and for the nation, came deep and lasting
trouble. But, on the whole, they were a class to be much
admired; some of their names, like Bridger and Kit Carson,
are imperishably woven into history and literature; others,
like Jedediah Smith, are to the general reader unknown.

<p>
This period opens with the death of the dominant figure of
the Missouri River trade from the beginning of the century,
especially from the date of the Louisiana Purchase, Manuel
Lisa, who made his last voyage in 1820 and then closed the
epoch, and his own earthly account, forever. He may have
had all the faults charged against him, but nevertheless he
seems not to have committed any grave offence, and he possessed
commanding ability, so that his life appears to balance
well. In a letter to General Clark, Superintendent of the
Western Tribes, resigning the position of sub agent, which he
had held for three years—1814 to 1817,—he explains his influence
over the natives by his fair dealing and by his kindness to
them. He gave them pumpkin, potato, and other seed; his
blacksmiths worked for them without charge; he lent them
traps, and his forts were the refuge of the old and feeble.
He was the most active man of his period. But the beginning
of this decade saw another active man come to the
top, the man who started the actual breaking of the Rocky
Mountain Wilderness, and who, with his employees and the
"free" trappers and freebooters who followed their lead, soon
penetrated the secret places of Mexican territory. This was
William H. Ashley, a brigadier-general of militia in Missouri,
the first lieutenant-governor, and later twice a member of
Congress from the newly created State. He was a Virginian
who came to St. Louis in 1802, the year before the transfer of
Louisiana. He was then twenty-four, a man of education,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
of great executive ability, and of unfaltering courage. He
was forty-eight when the third decade of the century opened,
with which his name is so closely associated that it might
almost be called the Ashley decade. Not that he was the first to
cross the mountain barrier into Mexican territory, for Etienne
Provost (Provo) had gone to Salt Lake in the very first year,
and there were others, of whom little or no record is preserved.
Samuel Adams Ruddock, in 1821, went from Council Bluffs
to Santa Fé and thence north, apparently about on the line
of Escalante's old trail, to Salt Lake valley, performing a
memorable journey, but Ashley was the master organiser who
dealt the obstinate Wilderness its death-blow, battering a permanent
breach that was quickly widened. In 1822 he built a
fort on the Yellowstone. With twenty-eight men, the following
year, he started to make his first attack on the frontal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
mountains. The Arikaras by this time had more than ever
determined to obstruct the entrance of the whites into their
territory and sharply repelled the company, killing fourteen
of the party and wounding ten. Such an overwhelming defeat
would have completely vanquished many leaders, but
Ashley, who had a large investment in this venture, did not
falter, and next year, 1824, when the time came to move on
he was ready, and they marched to success.
</p>

<p>
With him were a number of men soon to become celebrated
in Wilderness breaking, among them Andrew Henry, who had
crossed the Continental Divide to Snake River as early as 1809;
Fitzpatrick, William Sublette, Green, after whom Green River
is supposed to have been named; Jim Bridger, then a youth
of nineteen; and the extremely religious as well as unflinching
trapper, Jedediah Smith, one of the boldest, strongest, most
skilful, and altogether admirable characters of the time, a veritable
knight in buckskin, whose career was a continual romance.
Andrew Henry, who, as mentioned, had long before explored
and trapped in the country, in connection with Lisa and the
Missouri Fur Company, at the time when he established the
fort on the head of Snake River, which Wilson Price Hunt
visited and temporarily occupied, had then discovered South
Pass, a discovery which has been erroneously awarded to
others of a later time. Of course, even he only followed an
Amerind trail. Ashley led his band up the North Platte, about
on the track of Robert Stuart's eastward journey from Astoria
of 1812-13, named the Sweetwater Branch, and passed over to
Green River Valley, an inviting basin surrounded by high
mountains, the Wind River range on the north, and on the
south the point where the Green, then commonly called the
Colorado, Spanish River, or the Seedskedee, enters the Uinta
range by Flaming Gorge, the first of the thousand miles of
canyons now celebrated, which enclose the river and, together
with the rush of descending waters, make travelling by it
hazardous. This Green River Valley was adopted as the
rendezvous—that is, the point where all the trapping parties,
separating to pursue the hunt for rich beaver streams, should
again meet the following year to deliver pelts for shipment to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
St. Louis. The locality for a long time afterward was the
central meeting-place for mountain men and was known far
and wide.
</p>

<p>
Many of the trappers and traders of the early days wrote
or dictated books, and there is consequently a large amount
of literature bearing on the subject, but others, like Ashley,
whose story would to-day be invaluable, apparently recorded
little. Yet some journals may still come to light, for it was
not long ago that Coues discovered and printed that of Jacob
Fowler, who, in 1821-22, went across to Santa Fé in company
with Hugh Glenn.<a name='FA_84' id='FA_84' href='#FN_84' class='fnanchor'>[84]</a> Fowler and Glenn built the first real
house on or near the site of Pueblo, Colorado, and occupied
it for about a month. Then they went on to Taos and Santa
Fé. Glenn had a permit from the Mexican authorities to trap
and trade in their territory. The route was over the Sangre
de Cristo Pass by the regular trail, for many years travelled by
Spaniards, who inherited it from the natives. It passed down
to Trinchera Valley, in San Luis Park, where the sketch was
made which forms <a href="#i-003">the frontispiece</a> to this volume.
</p>

<p>
Fowler and his companions met with difficulties from Spaniards,
from lack of food, from Amerinds, and from bears. The
"white bear," or grizzly, at that time was numerous everywhere,
and the guns of the hunters being small-bore, muzzle-loading
flint-locks, they were of small service in a battle with
one of these impervious monsters. The cry of "white bear"
was almost as alarming as that of "Indians." On one occasion
a bear ran for shelter into a dense thicket of ten or twenty
acres near camp, where Glenn and four others pursued him. As
is usual with them, the bear kept quiet till the men were directly
upon him, when he rose and attacked Lewis Dawson. Glenn's
gun missed fire, but a dog worrying the animal Dawson was
able to get away, though only momentarily, for the ponderous
beast was again quickly upon him. Glenn's gun missed a
second time. Dawson ran up a tree, but the bear caught him
by the leg and pulled him down. Meanwhile Glenn, in another
tree, sharpened his gun flint, reprimed his piece, and put a
ball into the enemy. Several others now coming up also shot
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
and the bear was killed. But Dawson was badly hurt. He
was helped to camp, where, in Fowler's own words and
spelling,
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"His wounds Ware Examined—it appears His Head Was In the
Bares mouth at least twice—and that when the monster give the
Crush that Was to mash the mans Head it being two large for
the Span of His Mouth the Head Sliped out only the teeth Cutting
the Skin to the bone Where Ever the touched it—so that the
skin of the Head Was Cut from about the Ears to the top in Several
derections—all of Which Wounds Ware Sewed up as Well as Cold be
don by men In our Situation."

<p>
Dawson declared he had heard his skull break, but as he
was cheerful this was supposed to be imagination, yet on the
second day he grew delirious, and then a hole, supposed before
to be slight, was found to be so deep that the brain was
oozing out. The man died on the third day and was buried,
of course, on the spot. They were all sorry, but there was
no time for lamentations, nor necessity for them. The bear
was skinned, the oil tried out, Dawson's effects sold to his
companions, and the party proceeded, having painted another
picture of the risk of breaking the Wilderness with a flint-lock
gun. The disaster, however, like many another, was the result
of rashness,—in this case the plunging into a thicket where
a grizzly lay concealed.
</p>

<p>
A noted trapper and scout, belonging to what may be
termed the freebooter class, of which Edward Rose was
another but worse example, was James P. Beckwourth, who
years afterward, 1854-55, dictated a somewhat bombastic but
highly interesting story of his adventures, from which we learn
something about Ashley, in whose employ he was for several
years.<a name='FA_85' id='FA_85' href='#FN_85' class='fnanchor'>[85]</a> Beckwourth was a mulatto, part French, and Parkman
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
describes him,<a name='FA_86' id='FA_86' href='#FN_86' class='fnanchor'>[86]</a> from hearsay, as "a ruffian of the worst stamp,
bloody and treacherous, without honour or honesty," a rather
extreme and apparently unjust description. He performed
valuable services at times, and, while wild and reckless, seems
to have possessed a fair amount of honour and honesty. He
knew the Amerinds well, particularly the Crows, in which
nation he became a chief, and he declares the natives knew that
the whites cheated them; an important point in judging the
course of the various tribes. He was young when he first
went with Ashley—twenty-six,—but was one of the most
active men in the party—at least from his own story. At this
time Ashley's main camp was placed at or near the lower end
of Green River Valley, and the General determined, 1825, to
descend the river through the canyon to search for fresh beaver
ground. It has been stated that he intended returning to St.
Louis by this route, thinking the Colorado (Green) discharged
into the Gulf of Mexico, but this is disproved by the fact that
he did not take his fur packs along. He was merely searching
for more beaver. The boats were rude affairs made of buffalo
hides and were not at all adequate to the demands of the fierce
current, which carries one along with great impetuosity. Just
below the camp was some rapid water called "Green River
Suck," and this was probably at the mouth of Henry's Fork,
where the river first breaks into the rocks of the Uinta Mountains,
extending across its path, forming Flaming Gorge and
other canyons. For several miles below this the canyons are
short and not difficult to get in or out of, then Red Canyon
suddenly closes in and for twenty-five miles the bounding
rocks are high, steep, red sandstone, reaching at the highest
twenty-five hundred feet for a long distance, while the water is
torrential. Ashley's was the first attempt to navigate the
upper waters of the Colorado, a reckless procedure with such
boats, for they had no idea what might be encountered. The
stream falls about 450 feet before emerging into Brown's Park,
or "Hole," as it was originally named, after Brown, a trapper
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
who once lived there. From the term "Hole" some writers
have been misled into supposing that this is a very dangerous
part of the river, and that it was there that Ashley met his
great danger; but, on the contrary, the Hole is one of the few
openings, or wide valleys, on the Colorado, and the river
meanders through it quite tamely, with level banks and cottonwood
groves. Therefore it was between the foot of Green
River Valley and this Hole, now Brown's Park, that Ashley
lost two of his boats, risked his life in the rapids, and nearly
starved to death. Some have laid his trail through the Canyon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
of Lodore, but this follows Brown's Park, where escape
is easy.

<p>
The men grew weak and disheartened, and after six days
without food they reached the limit of endurance. They proposed
drawing lots, according to Beckwourth, to see which one
should die to create food for the others. But Ashley implored
them to postpone this hideous alternative at least another
twenty-four hours, and meanwhile led them rapidly forward in
the hope of coming to the end of the gorge. This fortunately
they did, and came out into Brown's Hole to find Provost
camped there with abundant provisions and horses. With
him they went across the mountains to Salt Lake, and thence
back to the rendezvous.

<p>
Owing to frequent battles between the Hudson Bay Company
and the North-west Company, both of which operated
mainly north of the 42d parallel west of the Rocky Mountains,
and north of the 49th east of them, these companies in 1821
were merged under the Hudson Bay title. Astoria had been
abandoned and their chief fort in the Columbia region was Vancouver,
just above the mouth of the Willamet. Their trappers
ranged the whole northern country, and at Salt Lake Ashley
met one of their chief men, Peter Skeen Ogden, with a large
quantity of furs which he succeeded in buying at rates that
much pleased him, especially as he was now heavily in debt.
With these he returned to the rendezvous, where soon the
trappers came in with splendid packs of furs, which, could
they be safely delivered in St. Louis, would immediately
retrieve the General's fortune and enlarge it.

<p class="caption_nb">
Ashley's name was found on right on the picture on one of the huge fallen rocks, about at the top of the old dead tree.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The fact of his entrance into Red Canyon and the date are
recorded, apparently by Ashley's own hand, "<span class="smcap">Ashley</span>, 1825,"
on a large rock on the left bank of the
river, over a sharp drop in the water, in
the upper portion of the canyon. Of this
I made a copy in 1871 and append a reproduction.
The rapid, or fall, at this point
is named after the bold General, Ashley Fall. The account
of the canyon trip is from Beckwourth, to whom the General
told it. I have never seen any other. I cannot understand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241' href='#Page_241'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
why they did not climb out, which could have been done in
many places; and the heights abounded in game. Perhaps
the reason was that, constantly expecting the end of the gorge,
they went on till hunger caused the high walls to seem unscalable;
or perhaps they were not in such desperate straits
for food as Beckwourth declares.
</p>

<p>
His rich cargo of pelts Ashley took to St. Louis by way of
the Yellowstone and the Missouri, building boats for the purpose.
On the way he met General Atkinson, an old friend,
who had been sent by the Government up the Missouri for
the purpose of driving out Hudson Bay trappers. These did
not then much intrude into that region, so his task was a light
one. Ashley reached St. Louis at last with the furs and from
being in debt became rich. He treated his men handsomely,
putting them up at the best hotel with <i><span lang="fr_FR">carte blanche</span></i> as to
orders, paid wages in full, and for faithful service gave each a
present of three hundred dollars and a suit of clothes. Ashley
thus was more successful with his enterprise than Lord Selkirk
was with one he embarked in to settle the Red River country
in what is now Manitoba. He obtained in 1811 a large grant
there, but the North-west Company opposed him, not desiring
to see the country civilised, and finally after battles and bloodshed
the colony collapsed.
</p>

<p>
The year following his very successful return, Ashley, 1826,
went again to the mountains, taking a six-pounder with him all
the way to Utah Lake, then called Ashley's Lake, where he
built a fort. His men had ramified in every direction, busily
trapping during his absence. It was in the winter of 1824-25
that Bridger, to decide a bet between two comrades as to
where Bear River emptied, was selected to trace the stream
from their camp in Cache Valley, to find out. Thus he came
to Salt Lake and tasted its waters. The report he took back
to the camp caused the men to believe that this salt water was
an arm of the sea, an idea which was not dispelled till the
spring of 1826, when four of the men circumnavigated it in a
skin canoe, searching for beaver streams. Robert Campbell,
who was in Cache Valley when the party came back, is firm in
awarding the honour of discovering Salt Lake to Bridger, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
as Provost had been in that neighbourhood as early as 1820 he
may have seen the lake before Bridger, and it has been asserted
that he did.
</p>

<p>
The treatment of the natives was often abominable, and
each year the breach between whites and Amerinds widened.
Clarke, of the Astoria enterprise, had hung a Nez Perce in full
view of his comrades because he stole a silver mug, and it was
such treatment as this, and the shooting of them for "fun,"
that convinced them they must eternally fight the white man's
advance. They therefore adopted various methods. One
favourite exploit was to run away with horses, to accomplish
which they would sometimes pretend friendship. These incidents
were sudden and startling. Beckwourth relates this one:
"We encamped that night, keeping a strong guard, and saw all
round us, as far as the eye could extend, numerous signal
fires." At daylight operations began. The cry went up:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The ropes are cut! Shoot them down! Rifles began to crack,
and six of the Indians fell, five of whom were instantly scalped (for
scalps are taken off with greater ease while the bodies are warm), and
the remaining Indian having crawled into the river after receiving
his wound, his scalp was lost. One of their chiefs was among the
slain. He was shot in our camp before he had time to make his
retreat."
</p>
</div>

<p class="post">
The Blackfeet were always hostile to everybody, white or red,
and the Arapahos and Sioux were apt to be. Some tribes
were friendly most of the time; others were friendly all the
time.
</p>

<p>
Beckwourth describes numerous bloody engagements, especially
when he was a chief among the Crows, but doubtless
these accounts must be somewhat discounted. Once he and
Sublette dragged a wounded Amerind away from the enemy's
lines, although the desperate fellow clung to the grass and
made it a difficult task. They placed him for execution before
one of their own men, who had been wounded, in order
that this man might have the satisfaction of killing one of the
hated race. "But," says Beckwourth, "the poor fellow had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
not strength sufficient to perforate the Indian's skin with his
knife, and we were obliged to perform the job ourselves."
</p>

<p>
Ashley finally sold out his interest to Sublette, Fitzpatrick,
and others, who made up the Rocky Mountain Fur Company,
and himself returned to St. Louis to settle down and enjoy
the large income now his from the success of his energy and
judgment. He never went to the mountains again. He had
"handsome grounds" about his house, and enclosed within
them one or two of the ancient mounds which then were common
on the site of St. Louis. At this time in St. Louis there
was a variety of architecture. There were broad, steep-roofed
stone houses of the French; tall stuccoed dwellings with tiers
"of open corridors above them, like a once showy but half-defaced
galleon in a fleet of battered frigates,"—the houses
of the Spaniards; and the "clipper-built brick houses of the
Americans—light as a Baltimore schooner and pert as a Connecticut
smack." The population was seven or eight thousand,
extremely varied with plenty of trappers and frontiersmen,
who "think as much of an Indian encounter as a New York
blood does of a spree with a watchman."
</p>

<p>
Ashley was a popular man in every way and was twice
elected to Congress from his State. Beckwourth relates the
parting incidents when Ashley left his men in the mountains:
"We were all sorry to part with the General.... There
was always something encouraging in his manner; no difficulty
dejected him; kind and generous in his disposition, he was
loved equally by all.... He left the camp amid deafening
cheers from the whole crowd." The Rocky Mountain Fur
Company prospered under Sublette and Fitzpatrick, though
the enormous returns of the first years could not again be
secured. As every company had from forty or fifty to several
hundred men constantly at work, the beaver ranks were rapidly
thinned, and profits correspondingly diminished.

<p>
The Blackfeet were the greatest scourge to the region,
occupying toward the country around the headwaters of the
Missouri something the same relation that the Iroquois did to
the Ohio valley, and the Apaches to the New Mexican territory.
Sometimes they were met in the most unexpected way,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
as in the case of a trapper named Clyburn, who with one companion
was on his way to the rendezvous of his company with
the furs of a whole season. As they turned through some
timber to cross a stream they rode squarely into a Blackfoot
camp. Escape was impossible. Clyburn did not waver for a
second, but rode calmly to the head
chief's tipi, where he proclaimed
himself a friend who wished to pass
the night under his protection. The
chief received them coldly, ordered
his women to unpack the horses, and
demanded from the men an account
of themselves, also how they dare intrude
on his hunting-ground. These
questions were evaded and the men
tried to swallow some of the food
placed before them, though they felt
little like eating. Clyburn overheard
the chief say they must be killed.
He told his mate and instructed him
to watch closely and follow every
move he made. When it grew nearly
dark and the warriors were somewhat
off their guard, Clyburn suddenly
broke for the river, a hundred
yards off, with his companion beside
him. There were wild yells, shots,
confusion. Clyburn swam the stream,
hid beneath a shelving bank, and
when the search was abandoned looked about for the other
man. He was nowhere to be found and was never heard
of again. Clyburn succeeded in reaching the rendezvous,
where he refitted and once more went to the beaver grounds.
He had engaged for five years, and when his time was up he
started for the East. Going to hunt where the river made a
large bend, he missed the boat, and as they never waited for
any one he was alone on the plains and struck out on foot for
Council Bluffs, a thousand miles away, where he finally arrived
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
with barely strength enough to creep on all fours. These men
never gave up. Never did their nerve give way, never did
they admit defeat; it might crush them, but as long as a heart
throb remained they fought against it. Death alone could
check their efforts to retrieve a desperate situation. Two fine
examples of the highest type of the Wilderness breaker were
a father and son by the name of Pattie. Sylvester, the father,
was about forty-four, who had moved to Missouri from that
State famous for great hunters,—Kentucky. He was familiar
with frontier warfare, having served as lieutenant in the army
against Amerind foes. Courageous and intelligent beyond the
average, he was held in high esteem. The death of his wife
induced a species of melancholia, and on the advice of friends
he sold his property and fitted out, in 1824, a trapping
expedition to divert his mind. Distributing his children
among relatives, he yielded to the pleadings of his son,
James O., then about twenty, and added him to his party.
His goal was the upper Missouri, the region then most talked
about, but on arriving at Council Bluffs with his men and ten
horses loaded with materials for a trapping and trading campaign,
the commanding officer of the post refused him permission
to proceed as he had no license, not having known that
one would be required.
</p>

<p>
He was not to be easily thwarted. The Santa Fé trade
was growing and he decided to turn his course in that direction.
Selling his extra arms he bought more goods for this
trade, and then joined one Pratte, whom they had met on the
way to Council Bluffs, and who was preparing for the Santa
Fé journey. Sylvester Pattie was elected to command the
combined parties, many of the men having served as rangers
under him. There were 116 all told, with several hundred
horses and mules. Pattie conducted the affairs of the caravan
methodically and skilfully and they went up the Platte without
any drawbacks. The Pawnees welcomed them cordially, even
affectionately, and their intercourse would have been altogether
agreeable had not a war party come in at a village of Pawnee
Loups having with it a child captive, whose mother had been
killed and scalped. This harrowing spectacle of the unfortunate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
little redskin probably brought Pattie's own children
more vividly before him, and he offered to buy the boy, but
the Pawnees prepared to burn him as a part of their victory
celebration. The chief was unreasonably greedy in negotiating
to spare the child, so the Pattie outfit decided to take the
little prisoner away by force. The thongs binding him, over
which the flesh had swelled till they were not visible, were
removed, and he was sent to their camp. With arms in readiness,
Pattie told the chief they meant to keep the boy. He
asked if they thought they could do it, to which Pattie replied
that they would or every man would die in the attempt.
"Save your powder and lead to kill buffaloes and your
enemies," the chief said, and accepted the offer of goods.
The incident is worth relating as it shows the temper of the
Patties, and many other trappers, who would lightly risk their
lives and all their possessions to save an unfortunate little
Amerind child.
</p>

<p>
One day farther on they met with some other natives.
The little boy was playing about the camp as usual when the
attention of the white men was suddenly attracted by loud
screams and cries.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Looking up we saw our little boy in the arms of an Indian whose
neck he was closely clasping, as the Indian pressed him to his
bosom, kissing him and crying at the same time. As we moved towards
the spot, the Indian approached us still holding the child in his
arms; and falling on his knees made us a long speech which we
understood only through his signs."
</p>
</div>

<p class="post">
This was the father of the boy.
</p>

<p>
White bears were met and one of their men was "literally
torn to pieces" by one and died five days after. Pattie
counted in one day 220 of these grizzlies. A few days farther
on they witnessed a great battle between Comanches and
Iotans. "The discharge of their firearms and the clashing of
their different weapons, together with their war yell and the
shrieks of the wounded and dying, were fit accompaniments to
the savage actors and scene. The contest lasted about fifteen
minutes,"—the Comanches being vanquished.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At last they arrived at San Fernandez de Taos and then at
Santa Fé, which had a population of about five thousand.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</p>
</div>

<p>
With some trouble they obtained permission to trap on the
Gila, "a river," says Pattie, "never before explored by white
people." They soon came into the country of the Apaches,
and one of the men was killed in an advance party. When
the Patties came to the point they saw the remains. "They
had cut him in quarters after the fashion of butchers. His
head with the hat on was stuck on a stake." It was full of
arrows.
</p>

<p>
After considerable manœuvring around New Mexico, James
O. Pattie again went trapping down the Gila and its branches
to the Colorado River in 1826. Up the Colorado he went to
the Grand Canyon, the first American apparently to see it,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
then across country not far from the great gorge, probably on
the north, till they came to Grand River, Colorado, and in
April, 1827, they crossed the Continental Divide to the head
of the Platte near Long's Peak, whence they proceeded to the
Yellowstone, terminating there a remarkable traverse of this
part of the Wilderness. Pattie then went back to Santa Fé,
where his father had remained, and once more started out,
going to the Colorado, where they trapped beaver down to
the mouth, intending to go this way to the Spanish settlements,
which they thought existed there. Encountering the
great tidal bore they were nearly wrecked.<a name='FA_87' id='FA_87' href='#FN_87' class='fnanchor'>[87]</a> They finally
struck across for the California missions, suffering greatly for
water, and reached St. Catherine's in 1828. Here they were
arrested and Pattie the elder at length died in prison. James
O., with great difficulty after long captivity, succeeded in freeing
himself and returned to his home by way of Mexico,
arriving far poorer than when he started with such rosy hopes
and his father's strong support. The book which he published
is one of the most interesting in the whole range of this literature.<a name='FA_88' id='FA_88' href='#FN_88' class='fnanchor'>[88]</a>
Had he chosen to remain in the Wilderness there is
no doubt that he would have become one of the most famous
of trappers, but the death of his father took the romance out
of the life and he cared no longer for adventure.
</p>

<p>
William Becknell, in 1824, went far west of Santa Fé, and
in August of the same year William Huddart, with fourteen
men, went from Taos to Green River, and in so calling the
stream used the term for the first time on record. Green
seems to have been a denizen of Green River Valley before
1820. They probably followed the old Escalante trail approximately.
A battle with Arapahos finally compelled Huddart
to return to Taos with a part of the company, the others
having previously gone north along Green River.
</p>

<p>
The afterwards celebrated Christopher (Kit) Carson now
appears on the scene in New Mexico, 1826, only seventeen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
years old, but full of that courage, energy, and good judgment
which finally placed his name at the top of the list of Wilderness
breakers. 1826 was a fruitful year in exploration. Lieutenant
Hardy of the British navy came up the Gulf of California
in a schooner and entered the Colorado for some distance.
</p>

<p>
Pattie, the first American to see the Grand Canyon, so far
as I can ascertain, had in a general way explored the Colorado
from its mouth to the head of its Grand River branch. He
had not been able to enter the deep canyons, but he had seen
them from above, and had ascertained the character of the
great river which for the distance from at least White River to
the mouth of the Rio Virgin remained unbroken wilderness
for more than forty years longer, the last portion to be vanquished.<a name='FA_89' id='FA_89' href='#FN_89' class='fnanchor'>[89]</a>
Pattie's name has been little known in this connection,
and his extraordinary journey has not received the
recognition it deserves, for it actually holds a place alongside
the achievements of great explorers. The same year, 1826,
that Pattie made the successful traverse from the mouth of the
Gila to the Yellowstone by way of the Colorado and Grand
rivers, Jedediah Smith started from Salt Lake with fifteen
men and, proceeding south to Utah Lake, thence went southwesterly
about on the same trail apparently that Escalante had
followed in 1776, till he came to the Virgin River, which he
called Adams in honour of the President. He followed it
down to its junction with the Seedskedee or Colorado. The
Seedskedee or Green River was also known as the Colorado,
hence when Smith speaks of the Seedskedee in this region his
meaning is perfectly clear.<a name='FA_90' id='FA_90' href='#FN_90' class='fnanchor'>[90]</a>

<p>
The Mohaves were kind to him and provided food and
horses with which he went on to the Mission of San Gabriel in
California, the first American on record to go there. He spent
the winter trapping, and early in May, 1827, tried to cross the
range, probably near the head of the Merced, without success.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
Another attempt on the 20th of the same month, with two
men, seven horses, and two mules, occupied eight days and,
with the loss of one mule and two horses, they came down on
the eastern flank. In twenty days they were again at Salt
Lake. Chittenden thinks they crossed near Sonora Pass. On
July 13th of the same year Smith returned to California by
his former route down the Virgin. This time the Mojaves,
prompted by Spaniards it is said, set upon his party as they
were crossing the Colorado, killing ten of his men and capturing
everything. Smith at last reached the Spanish settlements
where he was thrown into prison. In November
he was allowed to go on condition that he would leave Mexican
territory. He had left the bulk of his party behind in
California, and now brought them together again. He led
his men to San Francisco and thence up to the Columbia,
meeting with success in trapping all the way. Finally he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
accumulated furs worth about twenty thousand dollars and
prepared to take them back to Salt Lake. He camped in the
Shasta country one night on the south bank of the Umpqua.
The Shastas seemed to be entirely friendly and Smith was
apparently thrown off his guard. They hung about camp,
and in the morning when Smith was on a raft searching for a
fording-place for the pack animals, having with him a little
Englishman and one of the natives, the latter suddenly seized
Smith's gun and jumped into the water. At this moment a
wild commotion at the camp indicated an attack there. Smith
quickly shot the Shasta with the Englishman's gun, and knowing
it would be death to return now to the camp made for the
opposite shore and at length succeeded in reaching Fort Vancouver,
the North-west-Hudson Bay post on the Columbia at
the mouth of the Willamette,—the fort which had taken the
place of Astoria, or, more correctly, of Fort George. Besides
the Englishman who was with him, only two of his men escaped,
Black and Turner, the latter having killed four Shastas
with a half-burnt stick which he snatched from the camp-fire
at the moment of attack. They were well received at the
British fort, and everything was done that was possible to
relieve their unfortunate situation. A party was sent to punish
the Shastas according to the Hudson Bay Company policy,
and the furs and goods were recovered. Sir George Simpson,
in charge, offered to send Smith with his furs to London the
next summer in the supply ship, but Smith preferred to sell
out to Simpson on the spot and in March, 1829, made his way
across by way of Snake River toward the rendezvous. Sublette
about this time sent out a party to look for him, and they came
together in Pierre's Hole. The journey back to Salt Lake
from here was easy after what Smith had accomplished. He
had executed two circuits around the remaining Unknown;
journeys that must ever stand in the front rank with those
of Lewis and Clark, Wilson Price Hunt, Robert Stuart, and
James O. Pattie, in the breaking of the Wilderness.

The Mexicans were restless over the advent of the numerous
Americans who now appeared in their settled valley,
which, for more than a century and a half, had lain completely
isolated from the outer world, a lone child of the Wilderness,
a sort of dreamland where one day was like another day, and
where years rolled into decades, even centuries, without any
one knowing it. The Americans, quick, sharp, bluff, energetic,
startled these slow people, yet the officials tried to impose
on them. Trapping was permitted because the Mexicans
did not know how to do it, but after the American had
reaped a harvest it was not easy to get away with it, for
by some flimsy subterfuge the furs might be confiscated
and the trapper on a pretext thrown into prison, as in the
case of the Patties in California. Nevertheless the American
trapping operations quickly extended over all the New
Mexican territory as well as over the region north of the forty-second
parallel, still undetermined as to ownership. British
mainly operated there. The ten years agreed upon in 1818
between Great Britain and the United States as to this tract
expired without their being able to come to an understanding,
and the agreement was renewed for a second ten years. Russia
came to terms on her southern and eastern boundary, making
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
treaties with the United States and Great Britain, the one with
the latter establishing in 1825 the lines of Alaska that were
inherited in 1867 by the United States, and only definitely
settled in 1903. Matters relating to the Mexican country and
to the Oregon region remained therefore for another decade
without political change.

The American trappers were not, however, deterred in the
slightest degree by boundaries, or diplomacy, or the attempted
impositions of the Mexican officials. They plunged, more
actively than ever, into their pursuit of the unfortunate beaver,
no matter where it led so long as they had rifle in hand, and
incidentally they were performing the whole world a service
by swinging open the gates of the Wilderness. Kit Carson,
one soon to become familiar with almost every part of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
vast region, began his exploits in New Mexico in 1826, at the
age of seventeen. A whole brood of these remarkable characters
appear to have been born at one particular period, as if
planned expressly to be thrown at the beginning of their manhood
into the vast Wilderness, to reduce it for travel by less
dauntless spirits. Carson joined a party of these men to trap
down the Gila and its branches in 1828, having spent the winter
of 1826-27 at San Fernandez de Taos learning Spanish, so that
he was able to converse with the Mexicans here and in California
where they went trapping on the Sacramento, finally
reaching Santa Fé again, where their furs were sold and the
party disbanded. Carson was alert, cool, honourable, exact,
with that abounding self-confidence that led him to balk at
nothing, and, though so young, move rapidly to the lead. I
knew a man of this type, who was so certain that nothing
serious could possibly happen to him that he was perfectly
nonchalant in every danger, but his eye was always alert, his
movements quick as a tiger's, and his aim unflinching and
sure.
</p>

<p>
One incident will serve to show this confidence and quickness
of Carson. While on Green River an Amerind stole six
horses belonging to the trader Robideau, who had employed
him. Carson and a Ute pursued. The Ute's horse gave out
and he would not continue on foot, so Carson went on alone
thirty miles farther, and came up with the culprit. The thief
saw him and rushed for shelter, but Carson fired so skilfully
from his horse moving at full speed that he killed the wretch
at once. His reputation for skill and daring had spread before
he was fairly of age. He fell in with Fitzpatrick, Bridger,
Sublette, Smith, and all the rest of the now famous coterie of
mountain men who so brilliantly adorned this epoch in the
Wilderness, and his career was filled with deeds of wild daring.<a name='FA_91' id='FA_91' href='#FN_91' class='fnanchor'>[91]</a>
He engaged one winter to hunt for the men at Fort Davy
Crockett, founded in Brown's Hole, and he then became
familiar with the course of Green River in that vicinity,
though he seems never to have cared to attempt the navigation
of its impetuous torrent. The great rendezvous in Green
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
River Valley also saw him often and he described it. At the
selected place
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"for the rendezvous, in the space of two or three miles upon either
side of the river, the bottom spreads out in a broad prairie, and the
luxuriant growth of grass, with the country open all about it, made
the spot desirable for a large encampment.... A scattered
growth of fine old trees furnishes shade at every camp, and immediately
about the great tent they afford protection from the sun to
parties of card players, or a 'Grocery Stand' at which the principal
article of sale is 'whiskey by the glass,' and perhaps further on is a
<i>monte</i> table, parties from several Indian tribes, and the pioneer of
semi-civilisation—the backwoodsman—has come in with his traps,
a few bags of flour, and possibly some cheese and butter, and the
never-failing cask of whiskey."<a name='FA_92' id='FA_92' href='#FN_92' class='fnanchor'>[92]</a>

At such a place the trapper, who had led for a whole year
his lonely life in the mountains, ran riot for a brief time, as a
sailor will after a long voyage; and then he vanished again
into the wilds.
</p>


<p>
Richard Campbell in 1827, with thirty-five men and a pack
train, travelled from Santa Fé to San Diego by way of Zuñi,
and this part of the continent at last began to be understood.
Intercourse between St. Louis and Santa Fé was gradually
growing in permanence and importance. Although McKnight,
Chambers, Baird, and others had ventured to Santa Fé to
trade as early as 1812, the conditions were unfavourable. They
were seized as spies and thrown into jail at Chihuahua, where
they remained for nine years. Their goods were confiscated.
When Iturbide finally succeeded, they were liberated. Glenn
and Fowler met them at Taos at the time they arrived.
</p>

<p>
William Becknell went out in 1821 to trade with the
Comanches, but falling in with some Mexican rangers, they
persuaded him to go to Santa Fé, where he sold out at prices
which netted splendid profits.
</p>

<p>
In 1822, a man named Cooper with his sons also made the
traverse of the plains with a party of about fifteen, arriving at
Taos with $5000 worth of goods; and Becknell a month later
with thirty men came again with another $5000 worth. He
took a more direct route than had been followed before, and
his party had a fearful time, nearly dying of thirst in the barren
dry region along the Cimarron, a river they were quite near and
did not know it. At last when they were on the point of expiring,
and some had actually cut off their mules' ears to drink
the blood that would flow, they discovered a buffalo fresh from
the river bank, its sides distended with water. It was instantly
killed and the water it contained saved the party,—a new use
for the animal.
</p>

<p>
This was the real beginning of the famous Santa Fé Trail
by which the great annual caravans found their way back and
forth between Franklin, on the Missouri, 150 miles west of St.
Louis, and the New Mexican capital. Independence finally
became the eastern terminal. Gregg has written an admirable
account of the Trail, and all who read it will acknowledge their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
indebtedness for the accuracy, interest, and general excellence
of this contribution to Southwestern history.
</p>

<p>
In 1824, an effort was made to use waggons. A party which
had twenty-five wheeled vehicles besides pack-animals, transporting
all together about $30,000 worth of merchandise, started
and arrived successfully. By government order J. C. Brown
then, 1825-27, with chain and compass surveyed the road from
Fort Osage to Taos. The natives gave little trouble in the
early days of the trail, and Gregg says the great hostility which
afterwards developed was partly due to the brutality of the
whites in killing natives, whether they had done wrong or not.
Instead of mules, oxen were later largely employed. As far as
Council Grove the traders usually travelled in detached parties,
but there the caravan was made up with some attempt at military
form. A captain was always elected, but he had little real control.
Gregg crossed in 1831 with a caravan which had nearly
one hundred waggons, drawn by mules and oxen in about
equal proportions. The value of the goods was $200,000.
The party had two cannon, a four- and a six-pounder, for cannon
were considered highly desirable for this work at that
time. There were two hundred men organized in four divisions.
A constant guard was set and all precautions taken to
prevent surprise. In Gregg's caravan were several Spanish
women who had, with their family, been banished in 1829.
The ban having been removed, they were now returning home.
They appear to have been the first European women ever to
cross the Wilderness from this direction.
</p>

<p>
The caravans, so far as possible, always proceeded with
order and regularity, and it is an illuminating fact that all
parties in the Wilderness which had such organisation and systematic
movement met with very little trouble. Ashley was
another example of this. Everything with him was admirably
systematised. Each man knew exactly what he had to do as
to the horses and everything else. At night the animals were
tethered with a strong rope, attached to a stake two feet long,
expressly made for this and fortified with an iron band at the
top and an iron point. His party was divided into three or
four sections with his most confidential men in command, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
the sections were subdivided into messes under reliable men.
When they went into camp, the position of each mess was assigned,
and they arranged their baggage, saddles, etc., as a
breastwork in case of attack in the night. The stock were
watered and turned over to the horse guard who kept them on
good grass nearby till sunset, when each man brought in the
horses under his care, put on a stronger halter, set his stakes,
and otherwise prepared the animals for a comfortable night.
Guard was set regularly, of course, and in the early morning,
if in dangerous country, two men mounted and scouted the
neighbourhood before any others were permitted to leave the
breastworks. On the march, scouts were constantly thrown
ahead, on the sides, and to the rear. No enemy could surprise
Ashley's parties, and they were also enabled to cover ground
rapidly.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"In this way [says Ashley] I have marched parties of men
the whole way from St. Louis to the vicinity of Grand Lake,
which is situated about 150 miles down the waters of the Pacific
Ocean, in seventy-eight days. In the month of March, 1827, I
fitted out a party of sixty men, mounted a piece of artillery (a four-pounder)
on a carriage which was drawn by two mules; the party
marched to or near the Grand Salt Lake beyond the Rocky Mountains,
remained there one month, stopped on the way back fifteen
days, and returned to Lexington in the western part of Missouri in
September, where the party was met with everything necessary for
another outfit, and did return (using the same horses and mules) to
the mountains by the last of November in the same year."
</p>
</div>

<p class="post">
This proves what good planning and proper organisation will
do. Had Wilson Price Hunt been as scientific and as cautious
as Ashley, his great traverse would have been exempt from
the harrowing disasters which followed it so relentlessly. From
that day to this, suffering and failure have more often been due
to contempt for adequate preparation than to any other single
cause.
</p>

<p>
The caravans of the Santa Fé Trail, also, moved with considerable
regularity and order, but their make-up was more
heterogeneous and there was no dominating control. Where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
there were many waggons, they marched in three or four
parallel columns, "but in broken lines, often at intervals of
many rods between." At night they were arranged in a quadrangle
with a gap left at the rear corner as an entrance for the
animals, which after grazing for a few hours were shut up in
this corral of waggons. One of the difficulties was the stampede.
This frequently started from some slight cause. The
oxen, even if yoked, dashed at headlong speed across the
plain, with the mules and horses intermingled. Oxen when
frightened were the most difficult to control and did not recover
their calm as speedily as horses and mules.
</p>

<p>
Mules were the most advantageous, but were also the most
expensive. They possessed one characteristic which was useful
as well as peculiar. They could detect the presence or the
approach of an Amerind long before it could be learned in any
other way, but I have seldom seen this peculiarity noted. It
was indicated by a restlessness, a pricking up of the ears, and
a general alertness as of a dog approaching game. When I
have been riding a mule in the mountains, I have often been
apprised of the approach of natives in this way, before I noticed
any other sign. I am satisfied that no Amerind could ever
approach on the windward a mule not accustomed to them,
without being discovered. It used to afford us amusement
when an Amerind guide tried to mount a mule, and we sometimes
were forced to hold the animal securely till he could get
on. With usual mule perversity, once the native was in the
saddle the scene calmed, only to be repeated when he tried
mounting again.
</p>

<p>
A cry of "Indians!" set the caravan in commotion, and
amidst great excitement all prepared for defence. If the
party were a large one it was seldom troubled, hence all who
wished to cross combined, forming an annual caravan for
mutual protection which went out and back at fixed periods,
but sometimes small parties ran the risk of crossing alone.

<p>
In the winter of 1832-33, twelve men with their baggage
and about $10,000 in specie left New Mexico for the States.
They met a large body of Comanches and Kiowas, who approached
one by one and in small bodies till they were all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261' href='#Page_261'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
beside the travellers, who began to move on. A man named
Pratt, trying to herd in two mules, was shot. A battle then
opened. The white men made a breastwork of their packs
and fought desperately for thirty-six hours, when they made
an effort to escape in the night. The owners of the money
told all to help themselves, and what could not be carried was
buried in the sand, where the Comanches afterwards found it.
The men stole away as quietly as possible in the darkness.
Five went west and at last reached a Creek village near the
Arkansas where they were kindly received. Only two of the
others succeeded in getting out of the Wilderness.
</p>

<p>
It was on the Santa Fé Trail in 1831 that the famous
Jedediah Smith finally lost his life. With his partners, Jackson
and Sublette, he had gone into the Santa Fé trade and
was on his way to that capital. In his remarkable career he
had escaped many dangers, and he was still a very young man,
but his hour was approaching. He started for Santa Fé over
the general route, but after leaving the Arkansas became lost
among the multitudinous buffalo trails. Gregg says: "He was
one of the most undaunted spirits that ever traversed the Rocky
Mountains, and if one half of what has been told of him be true
... he would surely be entitled to one of the most exalted
seats in the Olympus of Prairie Mythology." There was something
highly dramatic in the lonely simplicity of this dauntless
trapper's death amidst a wide barren waste, at the hands of
the race he had so often successfully opposed and eluded.
He set off alone to find water for his party in the dreary expanse
of the Cimarron desert, when on mounting a hill he perceived
what appeared to be a small river. It was the sandy
bed of the deceptive Cimarron. Smith scooped out a basin in
the moist sand and waited for the water to fill it, unconscious
of a band of Comanches lurking near. As he stooped to drink,
an arrow pierced him. With the indomitable tenacity and
power that so often had carried him through danger, he returned
the fire and two or three of the enemy paid with their
lives the penalty of bringing the gallant knight in buckskin to
the ground. The picture was exactly the composition one
would expect to find surrounding the last hour of this eminent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
and characteristic breaker of the Wilderness. His task was
done. Beside the treacherous Cimarron his bones are forgotten,
but his splendid fearlessness, his even justice, and his
bold enterprise in cleaving the silent mysteries have consecrated
the sands that drank his blood and dedicated the Wilderness to
a lofty future.

<p>
He had a brother, Thomas L. Smith, equally energetic and
fearless, but who lacked the refined moral tone of Jedediah.
He was widely known in the Wilderness, though more after
the manner of Rose and Beckwourth. "Pegleg" Smith was
his ordinary title because one leg had been cut off below the
knee. It had been so badly hurt in a battle that under Pegleg's
direction an Amerind companion amputated it with a
hunting knife and a keyhole saw. A wooden leg was then
substituted. This did not materially interfere with Pegleg's
peculiar business, stealing horses from the Mexicans and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
Californians, and trading horses, for he was in the saddle a
great deal and that was home to him. His operations had a
wide range. On one raid he succeeded with the aid of Beckwourth
and a band of Amerinds in getting out of California
by the southern route with about three thousand head; but,
after the United States acquired the Mexican territories, he
gave up his raids as he would not operate against his own
countrymen.
</p>

<p>
The frontiersmen—trappers, hunters, and traders—had little
respect for the Mexicans, and the treatment which the cupidity
of the officials led them to bestow on trappers who came into
their power tended to widen the breach. All along the line,
therefore, fires of resentment were smouldering which before
long were to break into flame and consume the Mexican power
in this quarter.
</p>

<p>
Gregg, who was nine years among them, said of the
Mexicans<a name='FA_93' id='FA_93' href='#FN_93' class='fnanchor'>[93]</a>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"They have no stability except in artifice; no profundity except for
intrigue; qualities for which they have acquired an unenviable celebrity.
Systematically cringing and subservient while out of power,
as soon as the august mantle of authority falls upon their shoulders,
there are but little bounds to their arrogance and vindictiveness of
spirit."
</p>
</div>

<p class="post">
The Wilderness breaker had no fear whatever of these people,
but much contempt for them. A few trappers were generally
a match for half an army of Mexicans. Milton Sublette, a
well-known trapper, brother of William Sublette, while in New
Mexico with Ewing Young, had his furs, which he had concealed,
seized and confiscated. The packs being damp were
spread out to dry, and Sublette recognised some unquestionably
belonging to him. Before the eyes of the whole garrison
he carried these away,
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"and concealed both them and his own person in a house opposite.
The entire military force was immediately put in requisition and a
general search made for the offender and his prize—but in vain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
... the troops seemed to have as little desire to find Sublette as
the latter had of being found; for his character was too well known
to leave room for hope that his capture could be effected without a
great deal of trouble."
</p>
</div>

<p class="post">
The governor, Armijo, "raved and threatened—had some cannon
pointed at the house—declaring he would batter it down—but
all to no purpose." Sublette finally got away with the
furs.
</p>

<p>
For amusements, Santa Fé occupied itself largely with bull-baiting,
cock-fighting, dancing, and gambling. A considerable
trade was carried on with the Apaches, war materials and
whiskey being exchanged for mules and other property stolen
from settlements to southward. The Sonoran Government
issued a proclamation declaring all booty that might be taken
from savages to belong to the captors, which led a party of
foreigners under the lead of an American to visit a large camp
of about fifty warriors with their families. Among these was
Juan José, a famous chief who had been educated at Chihuahua,
and who had harassed the Mexicans terribly. José was willing
to either fight or trade,
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"but on being assured that it was a trading party a friendly interview
was immediately established. A small field-piece which had
been concealed was loaded with chain and canister and held in
readiness. The warriors were then invited to the white men's camp
to receive a present of flour which was placed within range of the
cannon. While the Apaches were dividing this they were fired on
and a number were killed. The remainder were then attacked, and
about twenty slain, including José and other chiefs. Those who
escaped became afterwards their own avengers in a manner which
proved terribly disastrous to another party of Americans who happened
at the same time to be trapping on the Rio Gila not far distant.
They massacred every one—about fifteen."<a name='FA_94' id='FA_94' href='#FN_94' class='fnanchor'>[94]</a>

</div>

<p>
From this time forth the Apaches became the open, deadly
foe of all Americans as they had previously been of the Mexicans.
It became all round a war of extermination which ended
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
only when General Crook, many years later, finally captured
the last famous warrior, Geronimo. The Apache has been
much reviled, and he certainly was a terror and made that
portion of the Wilderness a dangerous place for Mexicans and
Americans, yet, estimated judicially, he seems to have had
some right on his side, and he was not more cruel or treacherous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267' href='#Page_267'>267</a></span>
than the whites. He went under eventually because of
the overpowering numbers of his opponents, but, considering
all the circumstances, it is doubtful if any people ever made a
braver or more determined stand against their acknowledged
enemies and oppressors than did the Apaches.
</p>

<p>
Gold mines were now worked in New Mexico, <i><span lang="es_ES">El Real de
Dolores</span></i>, the chief one, turning out about $75,000 a year between
1832-35. It was opened in 1828. The gold was washed
out in wooden bowls. No foreigners were allowed to work
mines, but, as noted, they were permitted to trap because the
Mexicans did not know how to do this. Besides, the governor
would often confiscate the results of the trapper's labours, and
this was an easy way of making money. Silver mines had
been only slightly worked in earlier days and not at all for a
century. The copper mines near Socorro were the most successful
in the country, at least till the gold mines began to be
opened.
</p>

<p>
Everything was primitive. Sawed lumber was unknown.
The buildings were mainly of adobe. Vehicles were <i><span lang="es_ES">carretas</span></i>
(carts) with wheels hewn out of a cottonwood log, with an additional
segment pinned on each edge and dressed into an
irregular circle (see <a href="#Page_177">page 177</a>), and required three or four yokes
of oxen to draw them. Ploughs were no more than a log with
a branch left on for a handle and a sharp stick attached for a
share. Agriculture was correspondingly primitive in its returns,
yet, thanks to irrigation, there was generally an abundance
of what was needed. Sheep were bred in enormous
numbers, as many as two hundred thousand to five hundred
thousand being driven to market in one year. Horses and
cattle were also numerous, and the skill of the <i><span lang="es_ES">vaquero</span></i>, or
herder, in riding and throwing the lasso was unsurpassed. No
horse was too fractious to ride, and he could catch an animal
by any limb he chose.
</p>

<p>
A favourite article of diet was the <i><span lang="es_ES">tortillas</span></i>, made of corn
boiled in water with a little lime till soft enough for the skin
to come off. Then it was ground to a paste on the <i><span lang="es_ES">metate</span></i> a
flat stone, and formed into a thin cake, which was spread on a
sheet of iron or copper, called a comal (<i><span lang="es_ES">comalli</span></i>), and placed over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
the fire, where it baked in two or three minutes. A sort of
thin mush called <i><span lang="es_ES">atole</span></i> was a favourite drink, and there were
also wine, and a sort of strong liquor called <i><span lang="es_ES">aguardiente</span></i> or
<i><span lang="es_ES">ratafia</span></i> (Taos lightning). Taken all in all the American trapper
did not have such a bad time in New Mexico after it left the
hands of Spain, so far as the people were concerned, and had
they despised the Mexicans less, matters would have been
pleasanter, though, as Gregg says, the government was whimsical
and oppressive, as much, however, to Mexicans as to
Americans.

A high tariff was laid on goods from the United States,
though it was generally compromised on the Mexican frontier.
When Governor Armijo, however, came in he imposed a tax
of $500 on every waggon, no matter what its size or contents.
The result was that waggons grew to the limit in proportions,

Between the Missouri River and the mountains there were no
settlements then, above Texas.
</p>

<p>
Thomas Forsyth, who had long experience among the
people of the Wilderness, said he thought that in most misunderstandings
the fault was with the white people. He told
of a young agent on the Missouri River who cut off the ears
of a half-breed because, when drunk, he had spoken disrespectfully
of the Americans. Another agent on the Mississippi
turned out of the guard-house an innocent Indian to others,
his enemies, who butchered him in the presence of the whole
garrison. Forsyth remarks, also: "In my intercourse with
the Indians for the last forty years I never found that coercive
measures ever had any good effect with them, but that conciliatory
measures always tended to produce every purpose
required."
</p>

<p>
The intercourse between the tribes of the Wilderness and
the whites was rapidly increasing, and this period—1830 to
1840—saw many hard conflicts and much bloodshed, some of
it, at least, entirely unnecessary. The whites came with the
firm belief that every native was an enemy, and they sometimes
took the precaution to shoot first and apologise, if at
all, afterwards.
</p>

<p>
Trappers and traders were now operating over all the
Wilderness excepting the portion which at present forms the
central part of the State of Nevada. As yet this had not
been traversed by any but Jedediah Smith for it was generally
barren and streamless, with no beaver. Of course, much of
the remainder was still unexplored, yet the general character
was understood. Books on the fur trade are apt to give so
little account of the trapping operations in the South-west that
the reader obtains the impression that there was nothing done
there, but while no large company operated, bands of trappers
for years ranged the Gila and its tributaries, the lower Colorado,
the Virgin, the Rio Grande, the Sevier, and other streams
in the south-western country where beaver abounded and where
some rich hauls were made, sometimes to be confiscated by the
Mexican officials or lost through the difficulties of travel in
that country.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270' href='#Page_270'>270</a></span>
</p>

<p>
William Wolfskill and a party of trappers in 1830 opened a
route to California, going north from Santa Fé across the head
of the San Juan, across Grand River, and Green River, the
latter in what is now Gunnison Valley, thence across the
Wasatch to the western base, and south along that through
Mountain Meadows and across the Beaver Dam mountains.
Thence it followed down the Virgin River almost to the Colorado,
where it struck across the desert to Los Angeles. For
many years afterwards this was used and in time came to be
known as "the Old Spanish Trail." I have never been able
to understand why this northern route was taken when a much
easier one existed by way of Zuñi and the Moki region. To
go north at all necessitated going as far as Gunnison Valley on
account of the deep canyons. The advantage of the mountains
was certain water and wood and grass, but this advantage
was offset by the southern Nevada region which is as
barren as anything in Arizona, and in the latter country the
Colorado Plateau with its magnificent forest would have
afforded a beautiful resting-place. Wolfskill afterwards settled
at Los Angeles and planted a vineyard which became famous.
Bell<a name='FA_95' id='FA_95' href='#FN_95' class='fnanchor'>[95]</a> says he was a hero: "A man of indomitable will, industry,
and self-denial; an American pioneer hero; one who succeeds
in all he undertakes, and is always to be trusted. He died in
1866, leaving a very large fortune."

<p>
The trappers and traders who entered the field in this fourth
decade of the century were so numerous that a very large
volume would be required to even sketch over their exploits.
There was one, however, who, because of his connection with
the army and of his extensive though not financially successful
operations, must ever be prominently identified with this particular
epoch in the breaking of the Wilderness. This was
Bonneville, a captain in the American Army who had leave of
absence to conduct a fur-trading venture. Chittenden<a name='FA_96' id='FA_96' href='#FN_96' class='fnanchor'>[96]</a> is
rather severe on the genial captain, and says: "After all it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271' href='#Page_271'>271</a></span>
will not be far wrong to say that the greatest service which
Captain Bonneville rendered his country was by falling into
the hands of Washington Irving." Unquestionably Irving
made the exploits of Bonneville tell to their full value, yet
while admitting that Bonneville was not scientific, that he improperly
overstayed
his leave, and perhaps
even more, he
remains nevertheless
an extraordinary figure
in the breaking
of the Wilderness,
and he punctuated
the explorations of a
long period together
with other striking
characters like Ashley
and Frémont.
As Lewis and Clark
gave the seal to the
first decade of the
century in this field,
Lisa to the second,
Ashley to the third,
so Bonneville gave it
to the fourth, and
Frémont to the fifth.
Irving's brilliant narrative
may have done much to distinguish Bonneville, and
place his name ahead of Sublette, Fitzpatrick, and others as
a dominating note, but that does not detract from his skill at
manœuvring in the Wilderness. Chittenden further says:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"As the manager of an expedition and as a popular leader
Bonneville was a distinct success. Had his function been that of
conducting a party through the country, he might have rivalled
Lewis and Clark in the skill with which he could accomplish it. He
managed his men with great judgment, ... he remained three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
years in the mountains without the loss of a single life where the
men were in any wise under his personal control."
</p>
</div>

<p class="post">
It is rather unfortunate that he did not make exploration the
basis of his operations.
</p>

<p>
Benjamin Louis Eulalie de Bonneville was of French birth
and graduated from West Point in 1819 at the age of twenty-three.
His family and La Fayette were friends, and the General
took young Bonneville back to France, where he lived in
the La Fayette household for several years. On returning to
the United States he was assigned to duty on the frontier and
there conceived the idea of getting rich in the fur business.
Granted leave of absence from August, 1831, till October,
1833, he organised an expedition with the aid of Alfred Seton,
who had been at Astoria when that enterprise as an American
venture went to pieces, but whose faith in the fur trade was
nevertheless very great. He and his associates provided the
funds and Bonneville was able to start in May, 1832, some
eight months of his leave already gone. He had 110 men and
twenty waggons drawn by horses and mules. His chief assistants
were Walker and Cerré, both well-known mountain men
of great experience. Both had been among the earliest to
cross to Santa Fé.
</p>

<p>
Bonneville's waggons were not the first to enter the great
Wilderness. Becknell used waggons on the Santa Fé route at
least seven years earlier. Ashley took his wheeled cannon to
Utah Lake in 1826, and Sublette and Company had already
taken waggons to Wind River. Bonneville was the first to
take them to Green River.
</p>

<p>
His route was up the Platte and the Sweetwater branch,
over South Pass to Green River Valley, preserving military
discipline all the way and meeting with no serious difficulty.
Five miles above Horse Creek on Green River he built his first
trading fort of the common pattern, a square stockade with
bastions at diagonal corners. Little use was made of it and it
soon acquired the title of Fort Nonsense.
</p>

<p>
The competition for furs was rapidly growing more intense,
for the hundreds of skilful trappers who had now been ranging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
the beaver grounds for a decade or more had perceptibly
thinned them down. Each company therefore threw every
possible obstacle in the way of newcomers, as well as of their
older rivals. Bonneville felt the effects of this condition.
Some traders also had their native clients under such control
that they would not deal with any one else. Bonneville once
thought he could drive a trade with a tribe where their British
visitor was short of goods, but they would not deal with him
at all.
</p>

<p>
Another man whose name is prominent at this time was
Nathaniel J. Wyeth of Boston, a man of fine character and
hopeful disposition, but with no experience in Wilderness life.
All of his men were likewise innocent of frontier knowledge.
Before leaving Boston they had attracted much attention by
camping on an island in order to harden themselves for the
Wilderness! At Independence, Missouri, he was fortunate
enough to fall in with William Sublette and Robert Campbell,
who were taking a train of supplies out to the rendezvous.
Wyeth therefore travelled with them. He now had eighteen
men, six having given up at Independence. He had provided
himself with waggons which could be converted into boats,
but at St. Louis, understanding that waggons could not be
used, he sold them and took to packs. He reached Pierre's
Hole July 8, 1832, while Bonneville came to Green River on
the 27th of the same month, Wyeth having passed him on
the way.
</p>

<p>
Wyeth was desirous of reaching the Pacific coast early and
did not linger anywhere. He, with the Sublette party, had
had a slight brush with natives on Green River. In Pierre's
Hole they were to add to that experience. A band of Blackfeet
having been treacherously fired on by the whites, war
began and all the trappers turned out to take part in it. The
battle was to the advantage of the whites, who were the larger
force and were armed with guns while the Amerinds had
mostly bows. In the night the Blackfeet made their escape,
and this battle of Pierre's Hole, about which much has been
written, was over. It was enough for seven of Wyeth's men,
who now determined to return to civilisation. They started
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
back and five days later, in Jackson's Hole, were attacked by
a band of Blackfeet. One of the men, More, became demoralised
with fright and stood still till the enemy came and killed
him. Two others, Foy
and Stephens, trying to
get to More, were also
shot, Foy dying on the
spot and Stephens several
days later. The
others succeeded in
reaching the camp of
Milton Sublette, who
had been shot in the
shoulder in the Pierre's
Hole affair. As soon as
he felt able to travel he
started with Campbell
for St. Louis, and Wyeth's
men accompanied
them. They met with
no further difficulty.
The Blackfeet all fell
back into Green River
Valley, but did not molest
Bonneville.

<p>
The Captain presently
decided to proceed
to the head of
Salmon River to pitch
his winter camp. Here
among the friendly Nez
Perces he and his followers
passed a pleasant season. Parties were sent in various
directions, and in the spring Bonneville went out on the plains
of Snake River. On the 13th of July, 1833, he was back again
in Green River Valley, and here he met the bands of trappers
he had sent out the previous autumn. Their success had been
small. The valley was lively with the returning trappers, not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275' href='#Page_275'>275</a></span>
only of Bonneville, but of the American Fur Company and the
Rocky Mountain Fur Company, both having rendezvous three
or four miles from Bonneville. The intercourse of the various
camps was friendly and agreeable and the valley was for two
or three months, during the off season of trapping, a very gay
place.
</p>

<p>
There was no danger of a hostile tribe attacking so large a
body of whites, hence life at the time of the rendezvous was
free from this fear. Another unusual and singular one came
up however. A mad wolf entered one of the camps and bit
several, some of whom died of hydrophobia. Mad wolves are
rare, but there seems to be no doubt of their occurrence. In
recent years the young son of a man in southern Utah, while
camping out with another boy, was bitten in the night by one
of these animals, and shortly afterwards died in great agony.
</p>

<p>
Wyeth had travelled down Snake River, across the Blue
Mountains, and then down the Columbia to Fort Vancouver,
making the first continuous trip on record from the Atlantic
to the Pacific, and the record trip was all that he had to show
for his investment and his exertions. Then he turned round,
heading once more for Boston, to form a company for the
prosecution of the salmon fishing. He was a man of elastic
hopes, and prepared to go again to the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
Bonneville, meanwhile, seemed not to notice that it was
about time for him either to return to his post or to apply for
an extension of his leave. He ignored the situation entirely.
His packs of furs were sent east, but the Captain sent no word
to headquarters, and on his own responsibility remained a
trapper in the Wilderness.

</p>

<p>
After forwarding his meagre collection of furs, Bonneville
prepared to try his luck in the Wilderness once more.
Although his orders were to avail himself of every opportunity
of informing the War Department of his position and progress,
he gave this matter no attention whatever, and without an
extension of leave plunged into another year's trapping and
trading as lightly as if army orders and obligations had no
existence. His furlough he had obtained ostensibly for exploration,
but, of course, it is clear, his real object was the fur
trade; exploration was not even a secondary consideration.
Had he met with Ashley's success he might have ignored the
War Department entirely. As it was, he ignored it for the
time being, and making no report, he was dropped from
the rolls.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, some of his plans were being executed and
there was prospect of a good harvest. He sent one large
party under his first assistant Walker, to California, though
the Captain afterwards claimed the great object of this expedition
was the exploration of Salt Lake, upon which he said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277' href='#Page_277'>277</a></span>
his heart had been set. Walker has consequently been severely
censured for disobeying his instructions, but Chittenden
declares the Salt Lake project was an afterthought, and he
seems to be right. "If this ambitious explorer [Bonneville]
were really so absorbed in his desire to learn all about the great
Salt Lake, how happened it that he remained three years in
the country and passed repeatedly
within fifty or a hundred miles of the
lake but never went to see it?" he
inquires. Salt Lake was then well
known, it was easy to reach, and
there was absolutely no reason why
Bonneville himself should not have
gone there and explored it if he really
had its examination at heart. The
conclusion is inevitable that at the
time he did not consider it a matter
of great importance; yet he may have
intended Walker to explore it on the
way to California.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</p>
</div>

<p>
At any rate, Walker, with his forty
men, started July 24, 1833, and, after
suffering somewhat from thirst in the
region west of the lake, abandoned it
for pastures new, and falling upon the
head of Mary's, or Ogden's, River,
now the Humboldt, of which he must
of course have had some previous information,
he followed its more inviting
valley, and there pursued a career toward California which
emulated the Forty Thieves in the stirring story of <i>Ali Baba</i>.
They were in the country of the "Shoshokoes," some of whom
took the liberty of appropriating certain traps. One trapper
who so suffered, declared he would kill the first native he saw,
innocent or guilty. He soon came upon two who were fishing
and instantly shot one and threw the body into the river.
This crime naturally caused the party to feel that they might
expect retaliation, and hence when a few days later they saw a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
large body of the natives around them, they believed a battle
was at hand. Thirty-two of Walker's men thereupon surrounded
about eighty of the supposed enemy and shot them
mercilessly down, leaving thirty-nine dead on the field. "The
remainder," says Leonard, who was one of the shooters, "were
overwhelmed with dismay, running into the high grass in every
direction, howling in the most lamentable manner." Farther
on, Nidiver, another of the trappers, noticing two natives
running accidentally towards him and away from Walker,
supposed they had committed some crime, and shot both with
one ball.
</p>

<p>
Such was the mad progress of this triumphal band. Similar
work was being accomplished in other directions. It was about
this time that the afterwards famous mountain man Joe Meek
came to the Wilderness. One day he shot a "Digger" who
was prowling about a stream where Meek had some traps.
Wyeth, who was with the party, asked why he had shot the
man.
</p>

<p>
"To keep him from stealing traps," replied Meek.
</p>

<p>
"Had he stolen any?" inquired Wyeth.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Meek, "but he looked as if he war going to."
</p>

<p>
There were some men who seemed to take pleasure in
shooting natives without any reason. Captain Bidwell<a name='FA_97' id='FA_97' href='#FN_97' class='fnanchor'>[97]</a> called
these "Indian shooters." "One of the Indian shooters," he
writes, "seeing an Indian on the opposite bank of the river
swam over, carrying a butcher knife in his mouth....
The Indian ran. The man with the knife crippled him with a
stone and then killed him.... Another Indian followed
later. One of the Indian killers hid and shot him." Another
time a man missed his bridle. He swore an Indian had stolen
it. "He fired at an Indian who stood by a tree one hundred
yards or so distant. The Indian fell back into the brush and
the other Indians in sight fled in terror." The bridle was
found later under some blankets in camp.

<p>
Walker passed the sink of the Humboldt and then struck
into the Sierra Nevada. It took twenty-three days to cross
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280' href='#Page_280'>280</a></span>
and they suffered for food, seventeen horses being used up for
this purpose and seventeen others being absolutely lost. There
was no game and they finally were reduced to almost nothing
and were glad to get a basket of acorns which a frightened
native dropped. Arriving at last on the western edge they
met with rocks so steep that it was with difficulty they were
able to descend. Here they killed three deer and a bear and
began to find a less inhospitable region, although at one place
they were obliged to lower the horses by ropes over a long
slope of loose rocks. On October 30, 1833, they reached
the foot of the range and appear to have passed through the
now famous Yosemite Valley, perhaps the first white men to
enter it.
</p>

<p>
They were soon in Monterey where they found the people
so agreeable that they had the jolliest kind of a winter. The
season passed, however, and the time to go back came. Reluctantly
they started in February, 1834, went up the San
Joaquin valley with native guides, and crossed the Sierra at a
more southern point than the outward passage; by Sonora
Pass, Chittenden believes, and he is doubtless correct. Then
they worked north-east till they came to their outward trail.
On the way they had further amusement killing natives, whom
they hunted down as a species of rare game. Several Mexicans
in this sport exhibited their skill at horsemanship and lassoing
by charging at full speed and throwing the rope over the necks
of the terrified runners. The noose tightening, the victims
were dragged and strangled to death. Some of the men joined
a party under a trapper named Fraeb, who hunted in the
mountains of what is now Colorado, and they ranged from
the Gila to North and Middle Parks. Walker went to the
rendezvous on Bear River to settle his affairs with Bonneville.
</p>

<p>
Walker had made a trip similar to Jedediah Smith's, but
with a smaller circuit, and it was now certain that the river
Buenaventura, which heretofore had been vaguely supposed
to flow from Salt Lake or from near it, to the Pacific, was a
myth. Bonneville, in a letter written long afterwards, claims
this as one of the great results geographically of his expedition,
yet he condemns Walker for not having explored Salt Lake, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
much easier task and one which, to a certain extent, had
already been accomplished though not placed on record.
</p>

<p>
Captain Bonneville himself, when he had arranged his permanent
camp the previous autumn on the Portneuf, a branch
of the Snake in south-eastern Idaho, set out December 25, 1833,
with only three companions to visit the Columbia River region.
Crossing the barren valley of Snake River about on the route
which by this time may be called the usual one, for besides
Hunt and Stuart, and recently Wyeth, the Hudson Bay Company
men often passed that way—the Oregon Trail in fact,—through
a thick layer of snow, he arrived at last, without any
unpleasant encounter with the bands of Amerinds he met, in
the valley of the Grande Ronde, on the eastern foot of the
splendid Blue Mountains. This fair basin was free from snow,
and was obviously the place from which to make an extensive
and thorough reconnaissance before attempting to cross the
Blue range, whose mighty summits lay between him and the
Columbia. But instead of doing this Bonneville wandered on
and presently was back on Snake River amid a wild array of
rocks and canyons, where, after desperate ventures, he was
forced to fall back. He tried to surmount the range and
failed. Farther back they tried again and butted their way
across with the usual starvation and fatigue incident to advancing
without proper investigation. At last they floundered
down to a tributary of the Snake where a solitary Nez Perce
was encountered who speedily led them to the camp of his
friendly tribe. Here their troubles for the moment were over,
and Bonneville gained the chief's high favour by curing his
daughter of an illness by means of a dose of gunpowder dissolved
in water. On March 4th they reached the Columbia at
Fort Walla Walla, a post of the Hudson Bay Company, which,
in the Columbia River region, had entire control of the trade,
as Bonneville, as well as Wyeth, soon discovered. Pambrune,
the agent, was cordial and treated them well as long as they
were in a measure his guests, but when they wanted provisions
with which to return he declined to sell any, on the ground
that it was not fair to his company to encourage competing
traders.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>282</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He advised them to return in company with one of his men
about to cross the Blue range by the regular trail on a visit to
the upper tribes of the Nez Perces, but Bonneville declined and
once more butted his way haphazard across the great ridges,
arriving at last on the Snake after much unnecessary privation.
At one point a horse approached too near an icy precipice,
and sliding down more than two thousand feet was literally
dashed to pieces, as they found on going to the spot to secure
the carcass for food. By May 12, 1834, he was again at the
Portneuf, where he found his camp removed to the Blackfoot
River not far away.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
Not satisfied with this trip to the Columbia, Bonneville
again started for that river on July 3, 1834, with twenty-three
men. He had not been on the way a week, before he received
word that the indefatigable Wyeth was at his heels, also bound
for the lower Columbia. About the same time a Hudson Bay
Company party appeared, so the prospects for company were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>283</a></span>
too good to suit the objects of the Captain. The Oregon
Trail was rapidly becoming popular in spite of its hardships,
and perhaps Wyeth's enthusiasm did as much as any other
single factor to advertise this great road to the Oregon country.
</p>

<p>
Wyeth was again on his way to put into execution his vast
scheme to combine fur trading with salmon fishing, for the
benefit of his "Columbia River Fishing and Trading Company."
He had with him sixty men, veterans of the mountains
many of them, and two naturalists, Thomas Nuttall, the
same who had gone up the Missouri with Hunt, and J. K.
Townshend, an ornithologist. There were also several missionaries
under Jason and Daniel Lee. Wyeth had made a
contract the previous year to bring out a quantity of goods for
the Rocky Mountain Company, but the managers repudiated
their obligation. When he arrived on the Portneuf he built a
trading-post to utilise these goods, and called it Fort Hall.
A flag, made of unbleached sheeting, red flannel, and some
blue patches, was raised above the fort, and twelve men well
armed were installed there. Wyeth reached the Columbia in
good order, and there made another post on Wapatoo Island,
but though his ideas were practical and deserved success, he
met with disasters and the Hudson Bay people had such complete
control of the whole Oregon country that, while his personal
relations with them were cordial, he finally gave up, sold
out, and returned to Fort Hall, which he also sold to the
Hudson Bay Company. Thence by way of Taos and the
Arkansas, he went back to Boston, arriving home in the autumn
of 1836. He had conducted all his affairs with admirable skill,
intelligence, and perseverance, but in business the Hudson
Bay Company was a rock, and he was crushed against it.
</p>

<p>
Bonneville went on down the Snake and over the Blue
range to Fort Walla Walla, being much impeded in the mountains
by a vast conflagration which made the air dark with
smoke and added a new danger to the difficulties of the great
mountains in his path. But his efforts to start trade on the
Columbia were foredoomed to failure by the power of the
Hudson Bay Company. This company had revived old Astoria
in 1830, they had Fort Vancouver, Fort Walla Walla,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
and others, covering every branch of the trade, and the natives
were loyal. Bonneville found it impossible to buy anywhere
the simplest articles or food of any kind. The Hudson Bay
Company was tolerably fair and just with the Amerind and he
appreciated this kind of treatment. At Fort Walla Walla
Bonneville's effort to buy food met with the same repulse from
the manager as on the former occasion. He therefore could
but retrace his steps to Bear River Valley where he passed the
winter of 1834-35.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1835 he met his parties on Wind River
and, adjusting the accounts, started for the settlements, where
he arrived on August 22d, his great enterprise over with very
meagre results to show. As a trading venture it was a dire
failure. As a geographical exploration it had little that was
new to present. The maps Bonneville made were partly copied
from Gallatin and others. Yet when all that is against him is
admitted, he remains a dominating figure of the time, a high
light in the picture of breaking the Wilderness. His name,
which he applied to Salt Lake, has by geologists been given,
as mentioned, to the ancient sea which once lashed the Rocky
Mountains with its waves, so that in geology, in geography, in
history, and in literature, it is permanently fixed.
</p>

<p>
"As a soldier by education and profession," says Chittenden,
"Captain Bonneville committed an unpardonable breach
of discipline in overstaying his leave of absence. It was more
than a simple lapse of duty, it was an act of ingratitude to his
superiors, considering their great indulgence in granting him
so long a leave." By special order of President Jackson he
was finally reinstated. He served in the Seminole and in the
Mexican wars and was made Brevet Brigadier-General. He
bought a farm at Fort Smith, Arkansas, and there, after 1865,
ended his days, dying June 12, 1878, at the ripe age of eighty-two.

<p>
The year after Bonneville went out to the mountains (1833),
a distinguished foreigner, Maximilian, Prince of Wied, made
the journey up the Missouri<a name='FA_98' id='FA_98' href='#FN_98' class='fnanchor'>[98]</a> with Kenneth McKenzie, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285' href='#Page_285'>285</a></span>
steamboat <i>Yellowstone</i> to Fort Pierre and thence to Fort Union
on the new <i>Assiniboine</i>. The <i>Yellowstone</i> was a boat with the
distinction of having been the first steamboat to go above Council
Bluffs. In 1831 she was taken to Fort Tecumseh, a little
above where Pierre, South Dakota, now stands (named from
Fort Pierre, which was named for Pierre Chouteau, Jr.), and in
1832 went as far as the mouth of the Yellowstone. On board
at this time was Catlin, the artist whose paintings of Amerinds
and whose extensive travels through the Wilderness have made
him forever famous.<a name='FA_99' id='FA_99' href='#FN_99' class='fnanchor'>[99]</a> The natives called the boat the "Big
Thunder Canoe," and the "Big Medicine Canoe with Eyes."
It was an object of wonder with them for a time, but they soon
accepted in a matter-of-fact way the new things the whites
brought to them. The steamboat on the Missouri was a great
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
boon to the traders and fur companies as it enabled goods to
be taken into the North-west with far greater ease and consequently
at less price. There was much rivalry among the
companies as heretofore. New ones were formed and the
competition was great. All sorts of methods were adopted,
many of them questionable, often dishonourable, to secure
advantage. As whiskey was prohibited by the Government,
and a rigid examination was made of every ascending boat,
there were many schemes for smuggling it; for every trader
used it, if he could, in his dealings with the natives. It was
the most profitable medium of exchange, and by means of it
a tribe could be literally skinned for a song. The traders were
there to take every advantage of the natives, and, except the
Hudson Bay Company, they hesitated at nothing that would
bring them money. They would have been perfectly willing
to exterminate the whole Amerind population in twenty-four
hours if they could have done it with great profit. In other
words, their sole care was to fleece the native for a company's
benefit. The beaver by 1835 were beginning to be alarmingly
scarce and attention was turned more and more to buffalo
robes and other furs, but there was yet much money to be
made in this field.
</p>

<p>
McKenzie set up a whiskey still at Fort Union, to get ahead
of the inspectors. Ramsay Crooks, who had long been prominent
in the American Fur Company, opposed the scheme,
fearing trouble with the Government, and he was right, but it
was put in operation. Wyeth and Cerré, passing Fort Union,
learned of it and reported to the Government, and William
Clark, of Lewis and Clark, who was still superintendent for
the Western tribes, was instructed to stop it. The matter was
finally allowed to pass without punishment, but it came near
bringing the American Fur Company to disaster. The persistence
with which the respectable fur companies forced
whiskey into the Wilderness and debauched the tribes there,
in spite of every effort of the Government to prevent it, is a
permanent disgrace to these companies and to their managers,
every one of whom, from chief down, knew that the wealth
they were accumulating by it was largely a swindle, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287' href='#Page_287'>287</a></span>
meant the impoverishment and wrecking of the people of the
Wilderness. It was bad enough to charge the poor natives
outrageous prices for cheap articles, but deliberately to intoxicate
them for profit can never be considered anything but
dishonour for every man, high and low, who permitted it to go
on without hindrance or protest, or who abetted it, and received
the money from such base sources.
</p>

<p>
Famous travellers now went for a turn in the Wilderness,
though most of them contented themselves with the part east
of the Rocky Mountains. Among these was Washington
Irving, in 1832, with several congenial spirits, one of whom
was Charles Latrobe, an Englishman, who wrote an interesting
book. This adventure of Irving was of value afterwards
when he came to write <i>Astoria</i> and <i>Bonneville</i>, albeit it was
brief. He saw the buffalo, however, and, as described, experienced
the excitement of the chase. Francis Parkman, at a
later time, followed Irving's example, and then gathered notes
for his <i>Oregon Trail</i>.
</p>

<p>
Various American and English sportsmen also sought this
fascinating field, but this volume is too small to record the
doings of the great numbers who now began to swarm into
the Wilderness. Many of them have written valuable books
which may be found in all good libraries.<a name='FA_100' id='FA_100' href='#FN_100' class='fnanchor'>[100]</a>
</p>

<p>
The missionaries began to turn more attention to the Oregon
country, and in 1836 Samuel Parker was sent by the Presbyterians
to that region. He took with him a medical man,
Doctor Marcus Whitman, and these two were practically the
breakers of the Oregon Trail for the gentler side of civilisation.
They went out as far as the Black Hills under the guidance of
the veteran trapper Fontenelle, a man as widely known as
Fitzpatrick, Sublette, or any of the other prominent mountain
men of the time. Fitzpatrick himself escorted them on to
Green River. Whitman was able to give medical attention to
many of those in the Wilderness, and he seems to have been
the first American doctor, or indeed the first doctor of any
nationality, who ventured there. In Green River Valley he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
took from the back of Bridger an iron arrow-head, which had
been there three years. It was the custom of the mountaineers
to do their own surgery. Sometimes it was successful,
as in the case of Pegleg Smith, sometimes the patient did
not survive the camp operation more than a day or two.
Sometimes they let "well enough alone," as in Bridger's case,
who allowed the arrow-head to remain. No anæsthetic was
thought of at that time, and Whitman performed the operation
under the admiring gaze of a crowd of natives and whites,
while Bridger never winced. Another arrow-head was taken
from under the shoulder of a hunter, where it had been for
two and a half years.
</p>

<p>
Whitman became so much interested in the missionary side
of the prospective Oregon work that he returned from Green
River to secure more help, leaving Parker to continue. Parker
says of the trappers: "Their demoralising influence with the
Indians has been lamentable, and they have imposed upon
them in all the ways that sinful propensity can dictate. It is
said they have sold them packs of cards at high prices, calling
them the Bible."
</p>

<p>
Of the rendezvous he remarks:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"These days are the climax of the hunter's happiness....
A hunter who goes technically by the name of the great bully of the
mountains mounted his horse with a loaded rifle and challenged
any Frenchman, American, Spaniard, or Dutchman, to fight him in
single combat. Kit Carson, an American, told him if he wished to
die he would accept the challenge. Shunar defied him. Carson
mounted his horse and with a loaded pistol rushed into close contact,
and both almost at the same instant fired. Carson's ball
entered Shunar's hand, came out at the wrist, and passed through
the arm above the elbow. Shunar's ball passed over the head of
Carson, and while he went for another pistol Shunar begged that his
life might be spared. Such scenes, sometimes from passion and
sometimes for amusement, make the pastime of their wild and
wandering life."

<p>
Parker reached Oregon safely, while Whitman was making
the eastward journey. On reaching New England, Whitman,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
who was only thirty-two, married. With his wife and another
newly married couple, the Reverend H. H. Spalding and wife,
he set out once more for Oregon, with the settlement of which
his name was now to become forever associated, even to the
extent of being called the "Saviour of Oregon."<a name='FA_101' id='FA_101' href='#FN_101' class='fnanchor'>[101]</a> It must be
remembered that the British Hudson Bay Company still maintained
almost complete control of the Oregon country, notwithstanding
the provision made by the two Governments that
the region was to be free to both nations. It was free nominally,
but, as has been seen in the case of Bonneville and in
that of Wyeth, as well as other Americans, the freedom was a
mere form. American trappers could pass through the country
without direct molestation, but it was an impossibility for them
to accomplish anything there. As the fifth decade of the century
opened, the question of boundary so long left in the air
became pressing. The time set for adjustment had arrived.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
It was particularly in relation to this that it is said Whitman
made a winter journey to Washington by way of Santa Fé in
1842-43. During his absence the natives grew more insolent.
Mrs. Whitman was obliged to flee to the Methodist mission for
protection. The natives were also suspicious of the missionaries:
the latter often held themselves superior to the trappers
who would have been their best friends; and the Hudson Bay
Company continued its opposition to American settlement.
A troublous condition all round was the result. A horrible
massacre by the Cayuses finally took place at the Whitman
mission, November 28, 1847, eleven years after the Doctor
began his enthusiastic work for Oregon. Doctor and Mrs.
Whitman with many others were most cruelly murdered,
some of the chief criminals being those whom they had often
befriended.
</p>

<p>
Doctor McLoughlin, the Hudson Bay Company governor,
while refusing aid to Americans, came to have much sympathy
for, and was later accused by the managers of the great corporation
of having promoted, American settlement. He was even
charged an enormous sum as damages the Company had suffered
in consequence of the course of action of which he was
accused. He resigned, settled himself in Oregon, and eventually
became an American citizen. The British desired an
adjustment of the boundary by following the course of the
Columbia River, but this was not accepted by the United
States, and it was not till 1848 that the line was placed permanently
where it now is; a continuation of the line on the
forty-ninth parallel, which had been adopted east of the mountains
long before.

One of the trappers intimately connected with the development
of Oregon was Joe Meek, who had ranged the Wilderness
for many years. He was possessed of a full share of the
qualities which abounded in men like Jedediah Smith, Sublette,
Bridger, and others of that type, and was seldom taken
unawares. One anecdote will exhibit his temper and at the
same time present a picture of the dangerous circumstances
which sometimes surrounded such men and over which they
triumphed. Meek was captured by a party of Crows in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291' href='#Page_291'>291</a></span>
Yellowstone country. His captors numbered 187 men, nine
boys, and three women. Meek calmly counted them while
they were discussing his case. At last the chief, called "The
Bold," said to him: "I have known the whites for a long time
and I know them to be great liars, deserving death, but if you
will tell the truth you shall live. Tell me where are the whites
you belong to; and what is your captain's name." Meek replied
that his captain was Bridger, and to an inquiry as to the
number of men Bridger had, he answered forty, which was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
lie, as Bridger had six times that number. The Bold laughed
and said: "We will make them poor, and you shall live, but
they shall die." For four days they travelled to attack Bridger,
and Meek was forced to do the menial work of the camp under
the ridicule of the squaws.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"On the afternoon of the fourth day," he says, "the spies, who
war in advance, looking out from a high hill, made a sign to the
main party. In a moment all sat down. I war as well up in Indian
signs as they war; and I knew they had discovered white men.
What war worse, I knew that they would soon discover that I had
been lying to them. All I had to do then war to trust to luck.
Soon we came to the top of the hill which overlooked the Yellowstone,
from which I could see the plains below extending as far as
the eye could reach, and about three miles off, the camp of my
friends. My heart beat double quick about that time and I once in
a while put my hand to my head, to feel if my scalp war thar.
While I war watching our camp, I discovered that the horse guard
had seen us, for I knew the sign he would make if he discovered
Indians. I thought the camp a splendid sight that evening. It
made a powerful show to me, who did not expect ever to see it after
that day. And it war a fine sight anyhow from the hill where I
stood. About two hundred and fifty men, and women and children
in great numbers, and about a thousand horses and mules. Then
the beautiful plain and the sinking sun; and the herds of buffalo that
could not be numbered; and the cedar hills covered with elk,—I
never saw so fine a sight as that looked to me then! When I turned
my eyes on that savage Crow band, and saw the chief standing with
his hand on his mouth,<a name='FA_102' id='FA_102' href='#FN_102' class='fnanchor'>[102]</a> lost in amazement, and beheld the warriors'
tomahawks and spears glittering in the sun, my heart was very little.
Directly the chief turned to me with a horrible scowl. Said he:
'I promised that you should live if you told the truth; but you have
told me a great lie.' Then the warriors gathered round with their
tomahawks in their hands."

<p>
Bridger's horse guard now approached to drive in the
horses. The Crow chief ordered Meek to tell him to come
up, but instead Meek shouted for him to keep away and to tell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
Bridger to try to treat with them. In a little while Bridger
came on a large white horse to within three hundred yards and
asked for a council. Little Gun, the second chief, finally was
ordered to go and smoke with Bridger, while the whole band
prepared for war. When Little Gun and Bridger were within
about a hundred yards of each other they halted and stripped,
according to Crow rules, proceeding the remaining distance
in a nude state, to kiss and embrace. Meanwhile five of
Bridger's men crept along in a dry ravine and were able to cut
off Little Gun from his friends. Now there was a great commotion
among the Crows. At this moment about a hundred
of Bridger's men came up and he called to Meek to propose an
exchange of himself for Little Gun. To this the chief sullenly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>
consented, remarking that he could not afford to give a chief
for one white dog's scalp. Meek thereupon was allowed to go
toward his friends as Little Gun approached his, and in a few
moments the exchange was accomplished. That same evening,
the head chief with forty of his men visited Bridger's camp and
made a treaty of peace to endure three months, in order that
they might join together to fight the Blackfeet. They gave
Meek his mule, gun, and beaver packs, and told him his name
should henceforth be Shiam Shaspusia, as he could outlie the
Crows.
</p>

<p>
The growing scarcity of beaver toward the end of the
thirties threw many trappers out of work. The fur companies
disbanded, and the men were left in the mountains not knowing
what to do. They therefore scattered in small bands in
search of profit and adventure. Meek was in Brown's Hole
in the winter, about this time, at Fort Davy Crockett. It will
be remembered that Ashley had come through Flaming Gorge,
etc., and Red Canyon from Green River Valley, and went out
to Salt Lake from Brown's Hole. Meek joined a party to go
down on the ice through the next canyon, now called Lodore.
The entrance to this gorge is very abrupt and magnificent, the
rocks rising suddenly and sheer to a height of over two thousand
feet, forming a monster gateway which can be seen for
miles out in the valley. Into this gateway, Meek and his
companions entered, doubtless the first whites ever to go far
within the solemn chasm. He says they travelled nearly a
hundred miles down this "awful canyon without finding but
one place where they could have come out, and left it at last
at the mouth of the Uintee." That is, they went through
Lodore, about twenty-one miles, Echo Park, one mile, Whirlpool
Canyon, about fifteen miles, Island Park, nine miles, and
Split Mountain Canyon, eight miles, or in all a distance
through canyons of about fifty-four miles. The remainder of
their journey was in the open Wonsits Valley. The place
where they thought they could have come out was Island
Park, which is a small valley enclosed on the west only by
slopes of the Uintas. There are also other places but more
difficult. About ten years later a party attempted the descent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295' href='#Page_295'>295</a></span>
in boats through this particular series of canyons and was
wrecked in Lodore. The descent in Lodore is 420 feet, and,
in the distance that the Meek party went on the ice, about 750
feet. A band of Catholic missionaries, according to Farnham,<a name='FA_103' id='FA_103' href='#FN_103' class='fnanchor'>[103]</a>
attempted the descent of the Colorado, presumably from the
point where the trail to Los Angeles crossed Grand or Green
River. They were never heard of again. The name "Julien—1836"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
is cut in three places on the canyon walls, one in what
is called Labyrinth Canyon, one near the foot of Cataract
Canyon, and another near the head of the same canyon. So far
as the records known to me go, the canyons below Lodore
remained absolute wilderness till 1869, unless this Julien passed
through Cataract, as is suggested by the occurrence of his
name.

The Uinta range extends across from left to right. The canyons through its eastern
flank are shown by the very dark portions. Brown's Park lies between two series.
The first, or upper, series was traversed in 1825 by Ashley; the second, by Meek and

canyons finally by Powell in 1869, clear down to the Virgin River.

<p>
A trapper made famous by Ruxton's romantic account<a name='FA_104' id='FA_104' href='#FN_104' class='fnanchor'>[104]</a> of
his doings was La Bonté. The Arapahos having killed four
trappers and run off with La Bonté's animals, he and his partner,
Killbuck, were after them. They discovered the camp
where the scalps of the trappers were stuck on a spear in the
centre of the circle. While spying out the situation, one of
the mules perceived them and gave forth a whinny. La Bonté
and Killbuck immediately fired killing two Arapahos, whereupon
the three survivors rushed upon them with loud yells.
The trappers, "drawing their pistols, charged at once, and
although the bows twanged and the three arrows struck their
mark, on they rushed, discharging their pistols at close
quarters. La Bonté threw his empty one at the head of an
Indian who was pulling his second arrow to its head at a
yard's distance, drew his knife at the same moment and made
at him. But the Indian broke and ran, followed by his surviving
companion; and as soon as Killbuck could ram home
another ball he sent a shot flying after them as they scrambled
up the mountain side, leaving, in their fright and hurry, their
bows and shields on the ground."
</p>

<p>
La Bonté now pulled an arrow out of his arm, while Killbuck
took his whetstone from the little sheath on his belt
and put an edge on his knife. Then, examining the first body
to see if any life remained, and finding the man dead, he proceeded
to the business of scalping.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Seizing with his left hand the long braided lock on the centre
of the Indian's head, he passed the point edge of his keen butcher
knife round the parting, turning it at the same time under the skin
to separate the scalp from the skull, then with a quick, sudden jerk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
of his hand he removed it entirely from the head, and giving the
reeking trophy a wring upon the grass to free it from the blood, he
coolly hitched it under his belt and proceeded to the next; but seeing
La Bonté operating upon this, he sought the third, who lay some
little distance from the others. This one was still alive, a pistol ball
having passed through his body without touching a vital spot....
Thrusting his knife for mercy's sake into the bosom of the Indian, he
likewise tore the scalp lock from his head and placed it with the other."

<p>
Killbuck up to this moment had been walking about with
an arrow through his thigh. The point being near the surface
on the other side, he pushed it entirely through, and cut the
head off below the barb, after which he could pull the shaft
out. A tourniquet of buckskin soon stopped the bleeding, and
he "brought in his old mule, lavishing many a caress and most
comical terms of endearment upon the faithful companion of
his wanderings." After a hasty meal on the venison which
the Amerinds had been cooking, they hurried away from the
locality to a camp of Utes. The latter were enemies of the
Arapahos, and when La Bonté told them the Arapahos were
coming the whole village was speedily in commotion: the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
squaws began to lament and tear their hair; the warriors, to
paint and arm themselves. A band of a hundred soon left for
the field, and La Bonté and Killbuck would have gone too,
but the chiefs forbade this, as their wounds were stiff and
painful and they were well worn out. So buffalo robes were
placed in a warm roomy lodge and they were left to rest and
recuperate.
</p>

<p>
On the Mexican frontier trouble had for some time been
brewing concerning the status of Texas in the Mexican political
arrangement. The Texans, who were now mainly
Americans, having followed the lead of Austin, desired to
have Texas a sovereign Mexican state, but a military government
was proposed by the Mexicans and a revolt occurred in
1835, which resulted in a proclamation of entire independence,
March 2, 1836. The Texans triumphed the same year under
Houston at the battle of San Jacinto. The western boundary
was laid without any just reason along the Rio Grande from
its mouth to the source and thence due north to the forty-second
parallel; but the Mexicans refused to consider any line
beyond the Nueces River, when the independence of Texas
was finally allowed. Therefore the boundary on the Rio
Grande never having been agreed to by the owner of the soil,
Mexico, it has no rightful place on any map. It never had
any existence, and as it is usually given without qualification
on historical maps, it is entirely misleading.

In the troublous times which now for a period fell upon the
Wilderness, a new figure comes to the front and dominates the
epoch with a force that resulted in attaching his name to it
forever and at the same time in rousing a great amount of
opposition and condemnation. This was John C. Frémont,
called the Pathfinder, though, as the reader perceives from the
preceding pages, the main paths had long before been found.
Nevertheless, Frémont was the first of his kind—the first to
follow paths for the sake of the paths themselves—the first
to record them properly—the first who looked at the Wilderness
beyond the peaks of the Rockies with sole reference to
the geographical problems that might lie there—the first to
pay attention to the botany and geology. He has been ridiculed

for likening himself when looking down on Salt Lake,
to Balboa but the injustice of this is apparent when we find
that he did not compare himself to the Spanish explorer, but
merely said he was "doubtful if the followers of Balboa felt
more enthusiasm" when they saw the Pacific for the first time.
Frémont, as a lieutenant, and about twenty-five, began his
work with Nicollet on the Mississippi and the Missouri in
1838-40. In Washington he met Senator Benton; and also his
daughter, Jessie, whom he married in 1841. In 1842 he was
selected to explore the region of South Pass and on this
journey he climbed the peak named for him,—the highest of
the Wind River Mountains. In 1843 he was out again, remaining
fourteen months, with a large party of frontiersmen.
He made a third journey in 1845-47, resigning from the army
on his return. His fourth, last, and disastrous trip was in
1848. In his several expeditions he went to Oregon by the
Bear River, Fort Hall, and Snake River route; to Klamath
and Pyramid lakes; to San Joaquin Valley; to southern California;
back over the Jedediah Smith (outward) trail from Salt
Lake; crossed the Rocky Mountains and Green River from
Utah Lake, and so back and forth in a number of directions.

In 1845 Texas was admitted into the Union as a State.
President Polk, on what ground is not apparent, agreed with
the Texans that the western limit of their domain was certainly
the Rio Grande. He might as well then and there have agreed
that it was the Pacific. General Taylor was ordered to occupy
the region west of the Nueces and he pushed on to the Rio
Grande. There was nothing left for the Mexicans to do but
fight, and this they accordingly did. Scott was ordered with
his army to Mexico, Kearney to New Mexico and California.
Santa Fé was easily captured in 1846, and the navy speedily
took the California coast towns. Frémont being in California
engaged actively in the insurrection there, and was much
censured for what he did. The Mexicans were vanquished.
In 1848 a treaty was entered into between them and the United
States, by which in consideration of $15,000,000, and the
United States assuming all claims, New Mexico and California
were ceded to the Americans—that is, all below the forty-second
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
parallel to the Gila and the Rio Grande. The latter
river now was admitted to be the western boundary of Texas;
a boundary afterwards adjusted with the Federal Government.
The Mexicans were left with nothing north of the Gila; the
British with nothing south of the forty-ninth parallel, west of
the Mississippi. The immense area which once had formed the
basis of so many broad and indefinite claims was now held by
a nation which had no being when the European countries
began their wrangling over this splendid domain. From Atlantic
to Pacific, from the Lake of the Woods to the Rio
Grande, one power was in control, and that power the very
youngest in all the world. The American nation had secured
for itself the most fertile, most diversified, and altogether the
finest and richest area on the entire globe. The Spanish sentinel
had been turned with his face to the wall; the British
sentinel was equally overwhelmed; the natives were cheerfully
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
poisoned with cheap whiskey; and it was now only a question
of settlement and communication between the widely separated
parts of the Republic.
</p>

<p>
The beaver was gone. Buffalo robes formed the bulk of
the fur trade. Even the buffalo were diminishing in numbers.
It seemed as if little incentive remained to lead people to brave
the discomforts and dangers of the western Wilderness. It
appeared as if the young Republic for centuries to come would
have a wilderness on its hands.
</p>

<p>
But under the very feet of the trapper struggling to earn
his small wage by exterminating the beaver, rich metals were
hidden; and Fortune was almost ready to remove the blindfold,
and lure the next set of Wilderness breakers into the
field.

<p>
The reports Frémont made of his several expeditions were
so striking and so important that Congress ordered thousands
of copies to be printed for free distribution. They
formed the beginning of the long series of invaluable volumes
the Government since that day has so wisely and so lavishly
published. First to present drawings of new plants and fossils
as well as to give accurate details of geography, they serve to
mark Frémont as the scientific Pathfinder. Botanical specimens
were classified by Torrey; paleontological by Hall, and
comment on the excellence of their work is unnecessary.
Altogether these expeditions of Frémont began a new period
in Wilderness exploration—the period of scientific examination.
He has been much criticised, but it was he who broke
the way for the numerous Government expeditions which followed
and which reflect much credit on the intelligence and
generosity of Congress. Few governments have ever fostered
the scientific spirit with a better grace or to so full an extent,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
and Frémont was partly responsible for this commendable
attitude. Through his enthusiastic labours the Far West began
to be more clearly understood than ever before. He took
no pessimistic view of the resources of the Wilderness as Pike
and Long had done, but was rather inclined to the other side.
It seems notable that he should so commandingly have stepped
into the vast field at a moment coincident with the collapse of
beaver trapping as a business; an industry which, as we have
seen, was responsible for the breaking of all the main trails
of the Wilderness, and for searching out every important
secret save that of the hidden fury of the Colorado. Not only
had the beaver been practically exterminated, but the bison
was on the decline.<a name='FA_105' id='FA_105' href='#FN_105' class='fnanchor'>[105]</a> Those beyond the mountains suffered
nearly to the point of annihilation in the exceptionally heavy
snows of the winter of 1842-43.
</p>

<p>
The Great Salt Lake, enshrined in the snowy mountains
and resembling the Dead Sea of Palestine, strongly appealed
to the imagination of a new sect which was to have a great
effect on the Wilderness, a sect which in 1830 began its development,
and notwithstanding vigorous and often bloody
opposition or possibly because of it, augmented steadily its
power. Those who adopted this new creed were commonly
called Mormons though they designated themselves as "The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints." The cult, like
others which have prospered, was originated by a very poor
and rather despised individual, Joseph Smith, near Palmyra,
New York. By his followers, Smith was believed to possess
supernatural powers as a seer and prophet. He had political
ambition also, for in 1844, he "published an address to the
people of the United States on the powers and policy of the general
government and offered himself as a candidate for the
office of President." Out of his visions and inspirations grew
the now famous <i>Book of Mormon</i>, purporting to relate the history
of the original people of the Western World, the Amerinds,
or "Indians," descendants by its authority of some of those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
who were dispersed and lost to history by the confusion of
tongues at the Tower of Babel. In Mormon belief it supplements
the Holy Bible, which they hold to be the history
of the Eastern World as well as the Divinely inspired
Word. Thus they have the Bible, the <i>Book of Mormon</i>,
the <i>Book of Doctrine and Covenants</i> and a book of guidance
called <i>Pearl of Great Price</i>. First success was due to Sidney
Rigdon.
</p>

<p>
After a number of migrations in search of the proper spot
whereon to found the New Jerusalem, the Mormons were
attracted by reports of the Great Salt Lake, lying in Mexican
territory, and in some degree duplicating the topography of
the Holy Land. Having much difficulty with their neighbours,
they were desirous of isolating themselves, and to them
the region of the Salt Sea of the Wilderness seemed the promised
land. Their Prophet Joseph had been murdered in cold
blood, June 27, 1844, in Carthage jail, whither he had been
taken from his Mormon town of Nauvoo, Illinois, having
there, on the advice of the Governor, surrendered himself for
trial on charges preferred by his opponents. The Mormons
resolved then to move bodily to the valley of the American
Dead Sea, wild and forbidding though it seemed. A thousand
miles of separation from their antagonists, by what was then
believed to be irreclaimable desert, was a condition they desired
and doubtless they believed that once established on that
foreign soil behind a barrier of mountain ranges, they would
there be able to develop their institutions unmolested. No
mind then foresaw the rapid exploration and settlement of the
Wilderness which has taken place.
</p>

<p>
Brigham Young, the new leader who succeeded Smith, was
possessed of unusual executive ability and clear judgment,
though with a limited school education. But no amount of
book knowledge could have replaced the qualities with which
he was born. Possessing such a commander; with a martyred
prophet in the background; with "persecution" unlimited;
the Mormons were equipped for sectarian as well as for civil
progress. Add to all this the suggestion of the Holy Land
found in the country of their choice, and the State of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
Deseret, as they wished to call it, was in a position to appeal
strongly to those who were looking for salvation in some
new form.<a name='FA_106' id='FA_106' href='#FN_106' class='fnanchor'>[106]</a>

<p>
It was not till July, 1847, they were able in numbers
to reach the Salt Lake, and doubtless the dry, barren, region
appeared discouraging. But Brigham Young, who followed a
little later, had not begun this move blindly. His astute mind
had shown him that irrigation by means of the mountain torrents
would transform into gardens the arid plains, exactly as
had been done in that dreamland of the Wilderness, the Rio
Grande Valley. At first the devotees of the Mormon faith
had a severe time, starvation was close to their thresholds, but
perseverance, grit, and industry gradually conquered the antagonism
of nature and the once forbidding valley was presently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
offering the Latter Day Saints abundance; Salt Lake
City became a centre of order and prosperity. Other portions
from this as a base were brought under cultivation and the soil
was rendered prolific. It must be acknowledged that these
people were Wilderness breakers of high quality. They not
only broke it, but they kept it broken; and instead of the gin
mill and the gambling hell, as corner stones of their progress,
and as examples to the natives of white men's superiority,
they planted orchards, gardens, farms, schoolhouses, and
peaceful homes.<a name='FA_107' id='FA_107' href='#FN_107' class='fnanchor'>[107]</a> There is to-day, no part of the United
States where human life is safer than in the land of the Mormons;
no place where there is less lawlessness. A people who
have accomplished so much that is good, who have endured
danger, privation, and suffering, who have withstood the
obloquy of more powerful sects, have in them much that is
commendable; they deserve more than abuse, they deserve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>308</a></span>
admiration, no matter what may have been their shortcomings
in the earlier stages of their career.
</p>

<p>
The fortunes of the Mexican War, which the Mormons
helped to decide for the American arms, as far as they were
able, soon threw them again within the jurisdiction of the
United States, and eventually, in place of their desired State
of Deseret, Congress established the Territory of Utah, and
made Brigham Young first governor, an appointment which
should never have been made if the Mormons were as bad a
people as by some was maintained. By it the Government
really sanctioned the Mormon creed.
</p>

<p>
Besides the Mormons other sects pushed into the Wilderness.
The Methodists and Presbyterians were early in Oregon,
the first under the Lees and the second under Whitman. The
Catholics also began missionary work in that quarter, and their
chief worker was Father De Smet, whose name is forever
welded into the history of the Wilderness, by his earnest
labours for one thing, but more particularly by his careful observation
and the records which he made of all he saw. He
went everywhere in the northern parts of the Wilderness, always
welcome, always doing good, and never in danger. More
ought to be related here concerning his career, but the limits
of this volume prevent.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the settlers in California startled the sleepy atmosphere
of the old Mission <i><span lang="fr_FR">régime</span></i>; yet the region was so
inaccessible from the East that few ventured to go there. But
Fortune was holding something in reserve. A blindfold was on
all eyes; no one could see the future indicated by the discovery
of gold near San Fernando Mission. It had been washed out
as early as 1841, but only in a small way, and it was not till
one day in 1849, when nuggets were found in repairing a mill
race on Sutter's ranch at the mouth of the American River, that
the blindfold was dropped and the people saw. In a general
way this was the end of what may be termed the Frémont
period and the beginning of another, which was to have a
tremendous influence upon the destinies of the Wilderness.
Emigrants crossed the oceans; they crossed the Wilderness;
they came from round the globe by thousands and by thousands
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
again, to wash from the golden soil of California their
everlasting fortunes. It became a stampede.
</p>

<p>
There were two routes from the East. One, the northern,
by the Oregon Trail, and the other, the southern, by way of
the Santa Fé Trail, both starting from Westport, now Kansas
City. A few years before they had started from Independence,
some miles farther east. The Oregon Trail was followed as
far as Fort Bridger,<a name='FA_108' id='FA_108' href='#FN_108' class='fnanchor'>[108]</a> a post established by the famous trapper
of that name, on Ham's Fork in Green River Valley, 1843, and
also as far as the great bend of Bear River, when the immigrants
made for Salt Lake and thence by way of the Humboldt
to and over the Sierras; or south about on the trail of Escalante
and Jedediah Smith, till it struck the old Wolfskill (Spanish)
Trail, which was then followed down the west side of the
Wasatch Range to the Mountain Meadows on the head of
the Santa Clara, across the Beaver Dam Mountains, down the
Virgin nearly to the Colorado, and then across southern California.
From Santa Fé two routes were open; one by way of
the Gila and the other northward over Wolfskill's trail, the
"Old Spanish Trail," to Green River at Gunnison Valley,
and then across the mountains to join the other trail coming
down from Salt Lake not far from the present town of
Nephi. The northern route by the Humboldt was the one
most travelled. The interesting incidents connected with
these trails and the California gold rush would fill a volume.
There were battles, scalpings, starvation, captivity, and privations
of all kinds. Sometimes a whole family was destroyed
at one blow, as in the case of Oatman, who had
ventured on without company. He was attacked by Apaches
on the Gila, the slaughter being speedy and, as the murderers
thought, complete, excepting two daughters, whom they sold
to the Mohaves. A son, however, recovered sufficiently to
escape. One of the daughters died; the other was discovered
five years later by Henry Grinell, and was bought by him from
her Mohave owners and sent to her brother in Los Angeles.<a name='FA_109' id='FA_109' href='#FN_109' class='fnanchor'>[109]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Another affair which stirred the outer world a few years
after this, 1857, was the "Mountain Meadows Massacre."
Just at this moment, owing to a quarrel between the Federal
Government and Brigham Young, a small army under Colonel
Albert Sydney Johnston, famous later as a Confederate leader,
was sent in a half-hearted and futile way against the Mormons.
This move was a great error on the part of the authorities, and
it hardly appears as if they were in earnest. Either a well-equipped,
powerful army should have been sent that could
have reduced the Mormons if they had done anything deserving
such treatment, which appears not to have been the fact,
or they should have been dealt with by arbitration and argument
as free-born citizens of the United States. The army
operations were a ridiculous fiasco, but nevertheless gave the
Mormons ground for the assertions that they were invincible.
A caravan of one hundred and fifty people from the Arkansas-Missouri
region was now on its way from Salt Lake to California
by the southern trail. Between people from that region
and the Mormons there had always been bitter feeling, and it
was now aggravated by the presence of the threatening army
and by contemptuous taunts which the immigrants are said to
have freely spread along their route, accompanied by vile
epithets. It is also said that they stole fowls and other property
and abused those who remonstrated. The result was
that when they reached Mountain Meadows, where they intended,
as was the custom, to rest before starting on the more
difficult journey beyond, they were attacked by a number of
natives and Mormon fanatics. The attack was a local matter
and had no authority then or afterwards from the officials
of the Church. The immigrants were well armed and made a
good fight, believing the attacking party to be natives all.
When the Mormon participants appeared on the scene and told
the Gentiles if they would lay down their arms the Mormons
would guarantee safe exit from the valley, they accepted the
proposition as an honourable one; they were anxious to spare
their wives and children further exposure. They went forth,
therefore, in confidence, but as they neared the south end of
the valley the miscreants, as treacherous as the lowest savage,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311' href='#Page_311'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
violated without compunction their pledge. The immigrants
were coolly butchered, for they were now helpless. Only a
few little children were spared, and John D. Lee, the leader
of the Mormon villains, perpetrated, according to account,
crimes unspeakable in connection with murder of the most
cold-blooded character.

<p>
A pile of stones was reared on the spot where the bodies
were buried, and as one looks down upon it to-day from the
waggon-road, which runs somewhat farther up the slope than at
that time, the grim spectres of Death and Dishonour appear
still to hover above the scene of blood; where savages were
put to shame in an exhibition of terrible depravity. A dismal
pall seems to pervade the once pure valley and doubtless always
will. At the north end the cutting of floods in the
stream-bed has destroyed a large part of the tillable soil, and
springs that once flowed abundantly have disappeared. Several
houses stand there, but they have a forlorn and dilapidated
appearance. The hand of Fate has laid a blight on
the place, and it will yet be many a long year before that
awful tragedy will not live again as the traveller passes over
the fatal road. No Mormon I have ever met thought for a
moment of excusing the action of the fanatics who led the
massacre. On the contrary, it has always been unequivocally
condemned.
</p>

<p>
Even Lee was at least ashamed of the part he played, and
he tried to persuade me in 1872 that he was innocent, that he
attempted to prevent the crime, and that he had wept when he
found it was to be done. Yet immediately after the event
he admitted to other Mormons that he had taken part. He
was "cut off" from the Church and for years lived an outlawed
life in the most inaccessible places, but he was caught and, in
1877, executed at the scene of his hideous deed. The massacre
was most unlucky for the Mormons, as the world refused to
believe that it was not secretly sanctioned. Unfortunately
for the poor immigrants one man who probably could have
saved them, and who certainly would have tried desperately
to do it, was absent from his home at the Meadows at that
time, being on his way to Salt Lake. This was Jacob Hamblin,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
the Leatherstocking of Utah, or "Old Jacob," as he was
familiarly called when I knew him some fourteen years after
the massacre. On another occasion when a fanatic, stationed
on the Muddy to assist immigrants, concluded to kill a
man, and said to Jacob, "This man must go up," Jacob answered,
"If he does I go up first, mark that," and the man
went free and never knew his danger; for it would have been
a reckless nature that would have dared to oppose the wrath
of Old Jacob.
</p>

<p>
Had he been at Mountain Meadows on that awful day
he would have saved the immigrants or would have died with
them.
</p>

<p>
Old Jacob was a remarkable character, and must hold a
place in the annals of the Wilderness beside Jedediah Smith,
Bridger, the Sublettes, and the rest of that gallant band. But
he differed in one respect from every one of them; he sought
no pecuniary gain, working for the good of his chosen people,
always poor and seeming to have no ambition for riches.
Honest, slow and low of speech, keen of perception, quick
of action, and with admirable poise and judgment, Old
Jacob was one of the heroes of the Wilderness, and one of the
last of his kind. Long ago I tried to persuade him to tell me
for publication the story of his life, but he then intended to
write it himself. Afterwards it was brought out by the Church
in the "Faith Promoting Series."<a name='FA_110' id='FA_110' href='#FN_110' class='fnanchor'>[110]</a>
</p>

<p>
In 1855 the Mormons had progressed far enough into the
southern Wilderness to settle on the Santa Clara near the Virgin,
and in 1861 they founded St. George, now the principal
town of that wide region. They also settled at Grafton and
several other places up the Virgin which winds its way through
a series of bounding cliffs that rival those of the Grand Canyon
of the Colorado.<a name='FA_111' id='FA_111' href='#FN_111' class='fnanchor'>[111]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As yet few white men since Escalante, in 1776, had crossed
the great canyon barrier of the Colorado between the mouth
of the Virgin and Gunnison Valley on Green River, a distance
of about six hundred miles as the river runs. Escalante had
hunted out the fording-place of the Utes, some miles above
the mouth of the Paria, the only place in all that stretch where
fording is possible even at the lowest stage of water, which
occurs in the autumn and winter. The trapper, Richard
Campbell, as early as 1840, perhaps as early as 1827, knew of
the Crossing of the Fathers, as it was called because of Escalante's
venture, and he also knew that a trail from Zuñi went
there, but whether he had crossed is not clear. James O.
Pattie had travelled along near the canyon edge for a considerable
distance and finally reached Grand River, but his route is
obscure, for his narrative gives few details of this important
part of his remarkable journey from the mouth of the Gila to
the head of the Yellowstone in 1826. When the Mormons
reached southern Utah the whole length of the Green and
Colorado from Green River Valley to the mouth of the Virgin
was mainly unbroken Wilderness, only the extreme upper portion
having been entered by trappers and the lower part,
except the crossing of a few persons at the Escalante ford, was
a complete blank. Ashley had made no record of what he saw
in Red Canyon, and his voyage there was forgotten. Meek's
trip through Lodore on the ice was likewise forgotten, and
several other futile attempts to solve the mystery of the Colorado
were vague memories in the minds of the trapper fraternity.
Bridger and Carson had been near the upper canyons
from time to time, and once Bridger attempted to explore the
Green by following along the land, but soon gave it up for lack
of water. He and his companions could see the river, but
they could not get down to it. E. L. Berthoud, the engineer,
in 1861 also made an attempt, but gave it up after one day for
the same reason. There was, indeed, only one way to fathom
the secrets of this river, and that was to start above with good
boats and go down on the tide; but as yet no man had appeared
with sufficient nerve and good judgment to make a
successful attempt at it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In 1861 Berthoud and Bridger explored a road from Denver
to Salt Lake by way of Middle Park, crossing the Green near
the mouth of the Uinta. This road was for the Overland
Stage Company. Owing to the Civil War the project was
abandoned, but a regiment of California volunteers marched
this way from Salt Lake to Denver. The distance was 413
miles;<a name='FA_112' id='FA_112' href='#FN_112' class='fnanchor'>[112]</a> and there was small record of the features of the Wilderness
through which the road ran. From the mouth of the
Colorado at the Gulf of California up to within a short distance
of Fort Yuma Lieutenant Derby, of the Topographical Engineers,
made an examination in 1851, and later that same year
George A. Johnson came to the mouth with supplies for
Yuma, constructing there some flatboats for the purpose of
transporting the cargo to the fort. The Gila at this time was
the southern boundary in this quarter of the United States,
but complications having arisen over an ill-defined portion of
the line a new treaty was negotiated by Gadsden in 1853, by
which, for a consideration of ten million dollars paid to Mexico,
the boundary was placed where it is now. The mouth of
the Colorado was not included, though navigation privileges
were granted. The mouth of the river is of no value to Mexico
and ought to be purchased by the United States, although
the difficulty of navigation renders it of comparatively small
importance.
</p>

<p>
In order to arrive at the Yuma post, situated at the mouth
of the Gila, a steamer adapted to this kind of navigation was
brought by sea from San Francisco by Turnbull. This was to
ply between the fort and the Gulf at the mouth of the Colorado.
She was named <i>Uncle Sam</i>, and it was only a few months before
she struck a snag and went to the bottom. The power of
the river, the immense quantity of sediment brought down
and shiftingly deposited by every slack current, the earthquakes,
and the fierce tidal bore, rendered navigation anything
but easy. Turnbull gave up, but Johnson took the contract
for transporting the fort supplies from the Gulf and soon had a
new steamer in service, the <i>General Jesup</i>. This was followed
by a second, the <i>Colorado</i>, one hundred and twenty feet long.
Johnson became familiar with every bar and current and for

In 1851 Sitgreaves reconnoitred the country about on the
trail of Garces, and in 1854 Whipple, also for the Government,
explored along the 35th parallel. The mighty gorges carved
through the great plateau prohibited north and south travel,
for they were well-nigh impossible to cross except at the one or
two places mentioned. A mountain range of equal length and
of the greatest magnitude would not have offered so tremendous
an obstacle. In 1857 E. F. Beale surveyed a waggon-road
along the 35th parallel for the Government, and Johnson,
in his steamer, the <i>General Jesup</i>, went up from Yuma early
in January, 1858, to ferry Beale across on his return from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317' href='#Page_317'>317</a></span>
California. Before meeting Beale, Johnson pushed his steamer
experimentally on up the river to the head of Black Canyon,
the highest point attainable by steamers under the most
favourable conditions. He did this to expressly anticipate
the exploration planned by Lieutenant Ives, of the Topographical
Engineers, who, the month before, December, 1857, had
landed at the mouth of the river with sections of a steamboat,
<i>The Explorer</i>, built in Philadelphia, with which he intended
to find the head of navigation and also map the river. Ives
conducted this survey with skill and accuracy, and while Johnson's
manœuvre took from him the distinction of first ascent,
nevertheless he remains the first explorer of the river in this
region. He went to the foot of Black Canyon with his steamer
and thence to the head of Black Canyon with a small boat.
He visited the Grand Canyon at the mouth of Diamond Creek,
the Havasupai Canyon, and also the Moki Towns. His report
is a model of graceful diction, but many of the illustrations
are preposterous. In 1866 Captain Rodgers took the
steamer <i>Esmeralda</i>, ninety-seven feet long, drawing three and
a half feet of water, up to Callville, not far below the mouth
of the Virgin.
</p>

<p>
The Mormons were desirous of opening a road to communicate
with the region east and south of the Colorado, especially
that the "Lamanites" might be able to come from there and
receive endowments in the temple of St. George according to
prophecy. Brigham Young directed Jacob Hamblin to undertake
this journey, and in the autumn of 1857 went with a
party under the guidance of a native to the Ute Ford, or
Crossing of the Fathers, where Escalante had broken the way
eighty-one years before. Successfully traversing this difficult
passage, possible only at a very low stage of water, he and his
eleven companions reached the Moki Towns in safety. Nearly
every autumn after this saw Jacob wending his way to the
same region, but not always without disaster. In 1860 the
party was turned back south of the river and one of their number,
young Smith, killed by the Navajos. In 1862 Jacob tried
another route to reach the same locality, going to the Colorado
by way of the Grand Wash, south-westerly from St. George.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' name='Page_318' href='#Page_318'>318</a></span>
At the river they built a boat and safely passed over. Then
they went south and east below the great chasm to the San
Francisco Mountains, suffering greatly for water in that arid
region. Crossing the Little Colorado they finally arrived at
the towns of the Mokis. But on the return Jacob followed his
original route by way of the Crossing of the Fathers, and was
thus the first white man to circumtour the Grand Canyon.
The next year he went again by the Grand Wash trail, touched
at Havasupai Canyon, and arrived once more among the
friendly Mokis, three of whom had accompanied him back to
Utah on the last trip. On this 1863 journey he was accompanied
by Lewis Greeley, a nephew of Horace Greeley, who
had come down from Salt Lake with letters from Brigham
Young. It was not till six years later that a crossing was
made at the mouth of the Paria, now Lee Ferry, still the chief,
I might almost say, the only available crossing between Grand
Wash and Gunnison Valley. Jacob Hamblin was the first to
go that way. The river is deep and a raft or boat is necessary
to transport goods.
</p>

<p>
In seeking a hiding-place John D. Lee found this point desirable
and settled there early in 1872, building a log cabin and
cultivating some ground. He began the ferry by helping
several persons across the river, the first being J. H. Beadle,
who had written a severe denunciation of him. Lee told me
he discovered Beadle's identity, but I have forgotten exactly
how. Lee called the place "Lonely Dell," and it was a name
well applied, for the precipices of naked rock rose high on every
side, and about a hundred miles separated the locality from
Kanab, the nearest settlement of any consequence.

Though the canyons of the Colorado had now been crossed
midway of the great six-hundred-mile stretch, and farther
north near Green River Valley had far back in the century
been penetrated to a limited extent, almost nothing was
actually known about them. Even at the most favourable
points approach to the brink was extremely difficult, and descent
to the water generally impossible. On each side the
country was for many miles forbidding wilderness, for the
journeys of the trappers, where they had penetrated, had left
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319' href='#Page_319'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' name='Page_320' href='#Page_320'>320</a></span>
no impression. It was as if no white man had ever looked
upon it. They were thus the final great problem of the Wilderness.
A stout heart was required to launch forth into their
unfathomed mystery, particularly as by this time numerous
tales of underground channels, fearful cataracts, and chasms
impossible of passage, went the rounds of the camp-fires. For
a time the Civil War withdrew attention from Western exploration,
but when it was ended one of the officers, who had gone
through the weary four years, and who wore in consequence
an armless right sleeve, turned his attention once more to his
scientific studies, and finally found himself, in 1867, exploring
in the Parks of Colorado. Here he learned of the wonderful
and forbidding canyons of the great river, saw some of the
minor tributary gorges, and also met and employed a rare
mountaineer, Jack Sumner, also a veteran of the Civil War.
Sumner says he suggested to Powell the descent of the canyons.
At any rate, Powell became enthused with a desire to
explore this remnant of the original Wilderness, and Sumner
was a more than willing companion in the scheme. Organising
an expedition Powell started from Green River Station,
Wyoming, in the same valley where the early trappers had so
often made their rendezvous, and which had also been the
resting-place for the California pioneers. He was a geologist
and his experienced eye and quick judgment doubtless soon
disclosed to him the probable nature of the interior of the canyons;
the probability that no insurmountable obstacle existed
to prevent his triumphant descent through the whole series.
But while he believed the canyon mystery could be solved he
went at it with no spirit of bravado. With him it was serious,
scientific business, solely for the purpose of determining the
geologic and geographic character of the mighty gorges in
which the river lost itself. As the difference between the
altitude of Green River Station and that of the mouth of the
Rio Virgin was known to be some five thousand feet, there was
clearly room for realisation of all the fantastic tales of the
mountaineers.

<p>
On May 29, 1869, with four staunch boats built in Chicago,
manned by nine men besides Powell, the party set forth on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_321' name='Page_321' href='#Page_321'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' name='Page_322' href='#Page_322'>322</a></span>
the swift current from Green River, Wyoming. They were
soon deep in the fastnesses of the canyon wilderness where
the plunging river roared defiance. As has before been mentioned
Ashley had passed through Red Canyon, one of the
first of the great gorges. Meek in winter on the ice had gone
through Lodore and the gorges just below it, and a party of
trappers had been wrecked in Lodore in attempting the descent.
The latter made their way to Salt Lake, where they
worked on the temple which the Mormons had begun. This
canyon of Lodore had disaster in store for Powell too. One
of the boats was wrecked, though fortunately not a man was
injured; but the accident produced trouble, as Powell blamed
some of the men for blundering, and they blamed him for failing
to signal in time.
</p>

<p>
When they reached Wonsits Valley one of the men, Goodman,
who was in the wreck, decided that he had had enough
of this river and made his way across country to the Uinta
Agency. The precipices soon closed in again to form the
ninety-seven miles of the Canyon of Desolation,<a name='FA_114' id='FA_114' href='#FN_114' class='fnanchor'>[114]</a> immediately
followed by thirty-six miles now called Gray Canyon before
an opening occurred. This opening was Gunnison Valley,
through which Wolfskill in 1830 had led the way, breaking
the "Spanish Trail" to California. It is from this point downward
for six hundred miles that no opening occurs in the cliffs
that bound the river. They become higher or lower, slightly
farther apart or nearer together, and there are lateral canyons
and minor breaks, of course, but there is no valley along the
river, and in places for miles on either side the surface of the
country is only barren sandstone. The cliffs reach altitudes
of three, four, and five thousand feet above the water of the
river. In these great depths men are as completely shut away
from the world as if they were in the very bowels of the globe.

</p>

<p class="caption_nb">
This gorge merges into the Grand Canyon at the mouth of the Little Colorado. The length of both together is about 300 miles.
The first to travel this distance were Powell and his men, 1869.
</p>
</div>

<p>
After passing through Labyrinth and Stillwater canyons
the Powell party found themselves at the mouth of Grand
River, which entered the main stream in a canyon thirteen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' name='Page_323' href='#Page_323'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
hundred feet deep, and they were at the same time in the head
of another great gorge, later named Cataract Canyon. Any
one who follows their trail will admit the appropriateness of
this title. The length is forty-one miles, the walls reach an
altitude of twenty-seven hundred feet at the highest, and in
some of the bends are so straight as to give an impression of
overhanging the spectator's head as he peers aloft from his
boat to the sky so far above. At least that was the impression
I received. The verticality of the rocks was greater to
my eye here than at any other point. For some distance the
declivity of the river bed is the sharpest on the whole course,
and this with the narrowness of the canyon began to disturb
Powell and lead him to fear that some of the stories of impassable
falls might be true. Fortunately no insurmountable obstruction
was encountered, and they swept triumphantly on
through Narrow Canyon and Glen Canyon to the head of
Marble, the real beginning of the greatest gorge of all, at the
point where Jacob Hamblin crossed a month or two later in the
same year, and which to-day is known as Lee Ferry.
</p>

<p>
Now there was before the party the greatest continuous
chasm on the globe, Marble-Grand, almost three hundred miles
in length as the river flows. Here they met with the hardest
work and greatest danger. They became worn out; food grew
scarce, for accidents and wetting had reduced too rapidly the
original supply. Then it seemed as if they could not proceed,
and the men who had been wrecked in Lodore were not reconciled.
Another joined them and, discontented, the three refused
to attempt a particularly bad rapid. They climbed to
the plateau and were killed by the natives not far from Mount
Dellenbaugh. The others, nerving themselves for a desperate
struggle, passed the bad place, swept on through more, and
emerged triumphant the next day, at noon, August 29, 1869,
at the mouth of the Grand Wash, and the end of the Grand
Canyon. The victory was won—the last problem of the
Wilderness was broken!
</p>

<p>
From this point down the river was known. Jacob Hamblin
with several others had passed from here by boat to Callville,
and thence to the sea Ives had explored as already noted.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' name='Page_325' href='#Page_325'>325</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was a dramatic triumph over the angry and rock-walled
stream which for three hundred and twenty-nine years, since
the Spanish captain, Cardenas, first looked into the deeps of
the Grand Canyon, had defied mankind. Powell and his men
were nearly exhausted by starvation-diet and exposure, but the
exhilaration of success sustained them, and help was near.
Brigham Young, hearing rumours of disaster to the expedition,
had sent instructions to some Mormons at the mouth of the
Virgin to keep a sharp watch for wreckage and to render any
assistance possible, and also for extra food to be taken there.
The day after emerging from the great gorge they came to
these men, Asa and his two sons, and enjoyed abundance of
food and the sight once more of friendly faces from the outer
world. The following day Bishop Leithead and two or three
other Mormons arrived in a waggon with more supplies, including
some fine melons, and the explorers were treated with
every kindness.
</p>

<p>
Powell left the river here, but Jack Sumner and the others,
except Walter Powell, went on down by river to Yuma
where Sumner and Andrew Hall wintered, going the next
year to the Gulf, the first and, so far as I have heard, the
only human beings ever to accomplish the entire voyage from
Green River Valley to tidewater. Sumner was a born trapper,
hunter, and prospector, and at last accounts was still roaming
the mountains engaged in these pursuits, another of those
extraordinary characters that belong to the original Wilderness
and will never live again. He knew Bridger, Baker,
Carson, and others intimately and had met Frémont and
Bonneville.<a name='FA_115' id='FA_115' href='#FN_115' class='fnanchor'>[115]</a>
</p>

<p>
When Powell, with his brother Walter, arrived at St. George
he went immediately to the post-office eager to get the mail
he had directed to be sent to this point.
</p>

<p>
"By whose authority," indignantly exclaimed the postmaster,
"do you come here asking for Major Powell's mail—Major
Powell is dead."
</p>

<p>
"By the best authority in the world," returned the Major.
"I am Major Powell."
</p>

<p>
"But Major Powell is dead," reiterated the official. Something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_326' name='Page_326' href='#Page_326'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_327' name='Page_327' href='#Page_327'>327</a></span>
then about the ragged, haggard man shook his confidence.
He said: "What evidence have you?"
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
"This," replied the Major, holding up the empty sleeve.
"I left this arm at Shiloh." He got the mail.
</p>

<p>
Powell would hardly have been able so speedily and successfully
to accomplish this feat had it not been for an event
which was contemporaneous,—the construction of a transcontinental
railway. This enabled him easily to place strong
boats and supplies on the banks of Green River. His great
voyage, which marks the end of the Wilderness, and the completion
of the railway, marking the beginning of an entirely
new epoch, occurred the same year. The rivers of the Wilderness
were not available for practical transportation. Those
east of the Backbone were circuitous and for the most part
too shallow for boats of much draft; those west were torrential.
Hence the necessity of the Iron Trail. In the search for the
best route for such a trail to bind the Hudson to the Golden
Gate a great many admirable surveys were made. Every one
of the expeditions was profoundly interesting and intimately
connected with Wilderness breaking, but it is not practicable
here to describe them.
</p>

<p>
The route finally selected was up the Platte, across Green
River Valley, to Salt Lake, down the Humboldt, and over
the Sierra Nevada to Sacramento and San Francisco. The
idea of putting a railway through the Wilderness was early
conceived, but owing to numerous obstacles and difficulties
as to route to be followed and as to finances, although the
numerous surveys were made, nothing definite was done.
As far back as 1850 Senator Benton, of Missouri, introduced
a bill authorising portions of road to be constructed with gaps
where it was supposed a line was not possible. In 1853 Congress
appropriated $150,000 for six surveys to be executed by
the War Department. The next year $190,000 more were appropriated
for three additional surveys. It is thus apparent
that Congress appreciated the importance of a line through
the Wilderness which should bring the Pacific Coast with its
now rapidly developing interests closer to the seat of Government.
In the dissension which began to rend the country
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' name='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
concerning the slavery question and State rights, there was
danger of secession in that direction as well as at the South.
The military importance of such a railway was beyond discussion.
General Sherman, who knew the conditions thoroughly
and had gone in 1846 to California, declared the Government
could well afford to build the whole line and would make money
by the operation, as it was indispensable for the transportation
of troops and supplies.

<p>
In July, 1862, Congress, though burdened with the terrific
war problem, passed the Pacific Railway Bill authorising the
construction of a continuous line from the Missouri River to
the Pacific Ocean. Two private companies were then formed
to build this line—the Union Pacific for the eastern part and
the Central Pacific for the western. These companies were to
receive Government aid as follows: 1. A free right of way 400
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' name='Page_329' href='#Page_329'>329</a></span>
feet wide. 2. An issue of Government bonds amounting to
one half the cost of the road. 3. An absolute gift of ten
alternate sections of land per mile (12,800 acres) on each side
of the line. 4. Privilege of using coal, iron, etc., from the
region through which building operations extended. 5. To
receive on completion of continuous sections of 20 miles the
bonds of the United States as follows: A. Between the
Missouri River and eastern base of mountains, about 650
miles, $16,000 a mile. B. Across the Rocky Mountains, 150
miles, $48,000 a mile. C. Across the Great Basin, $32,000
a mile. D. Across the Sierra Nevada, 150 miles, $48,000 a
mile. E. To San Francisco, about 120 miles, $16,000 a mile.

<p>
The Government also obliged itself to extinguish the title
of Amerinds to all lands donated. The State of California
assumed the interest for twenty years on $1,500,000 of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' name='Page_330' href='#Page_330'>330</a></span>
Central Pacific bonds, assistance estimated as the equivalent of
$3,000,000 in gold. San Francisco gave $400,000 and Sacramento
donated 30 acres of land. The aggregate of land given
to the two companies was ten million acres. Thus it seems
that the Government practically paid for the whole line. It
would have been better if it had built the road without the
intervention of the companies. About two miles a day was
made in track building, then considered rapid work. The
chief contractor was J. S. Casement, and William Dodge was
chief engineer. The workmen lived in trains which were
pushed ahead as fast as the road advanced and were supplied
with plenty of rifles and ammunition for protection against the
Sioux and other roaming tribes. These hovered about like
vultures, choosing opportune moments for attack. The assistant
engineer, P. T. Browne, with his party, was fired on sixty
miles west of North Platte. They fought for about two hours
against seventy-five natives. Browne was killed.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the Amerinds destroyed the track, captured
trains, killed engineers, firemen, brakemen, and telegraph linemen.
They also would destroy the telegraph line and carry
off the wire. In fact, they were a constant terror and menace.
But when denouncing them nobody remembers the swindles
perpetrated on them in former years, nor the bad whiskey
which impoverished them and brutalised them and won their
furs for a bagatelle. Their attitude was largely the result of
the earlier treatment they had received from the whites, as
well as of all the bad white blood which had been infused into
the tribes. One of the worst affairs was the Plum Creek massacre.
William Thompson, an Englishman, a telegraph man,
was sent out with a party of five to hunt up a break. They
started about nine o'clock one evening and when they reached
the place a pile of ties was discovered on the track for the
purpose of wrecking a supply train nearly due. Barely had
this discovery been made when Thompson and his men were
attacked by the enemy. They fired back and then ran. One
of the natives on a horse pursued Thompson, shot him through
the arm, and then knocked him down with a clubbed rifle.
Next he stabbed him in the neck to finish him, and immediately
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_331' name='Page_331' href='#Page_331'>331</a></span>
began the operation of removing Thompson's scalp. As
Thompson was far from dead the prospect was not agreeable,
but a movement would have brought death. His only chance
was to keep quiet and let the work go on, and he was able to
do this notwithstanding the pain. But when the scalp was
jerked loose he thought his whole head was off, and then felt
as if a red-hot iron had been passed over his crown.
</p>

<p>
The native tucked the scalp in his belt and mounting rode
hastily away, but in doing so dropped the scalp and its owner
picked it up. Thompson was obliged to remain quiet while
the band piled more ties on the track. Presently he heard the
distant rumble of the train. It was impossible to do anything
to prevent the wreck. In a few moments the cars were piled
in a heap. The engineer and fireman were shot and scalped;
the train was ransacked by the light of a huge fire. A barrel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_332' name='Page_332' href='#Page_332'>332</a></span>
of whiskey was opened and all got drunk. When daybreak
came they set the whole wreck on fire and gleefully danced
around it. When they were finally gone from the scene
Thompson crawled away and at length reached Willow Island
station, where a rescuing party found him. People came from
all around to see his ghastly baldness. He was taken to a
hotel where a doctor dressed his wound. "In a pail of water
was his scalp, about nine inches in length and four in width,
somewhat resembling a drowned rat as it floated curled up on
the water." Such were the incidents due to the wild tribes
which constantly harassed the builders of this iron trail.

But these savages were little worse than those who composed
a large part of the population of each terminus. They
had different methods, that was all. Whiskey flowed free and
drunkenness was, as usual with our European race, the great
recreation. Gambling dives and grog shops made up a large
part of the mushroom town that grew up at each official end
of the track. All manner of people, like birds of prey, flocked
to these places to secure a share of the money paid to the
workers, who were numbered by thousands. Some buildings
were fairly substantial, but there were many that were merely
board sides with a canvas roof. Others were "dugouts," that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_333' name='Page_333' href='#Page_333'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_334' name='Page_334' href='#Page_334'>334</a></span>
is, holes in the ground roofed over with sticks and earth; in a
side hill if possible. There were large numbers of tents.
Where there were vertical clay banks along a dry water course,
or a stream, these were burrowed into near the top, a square
chamber being made seven or eight feet long, five or six high,
and four or five deep, the outer side being closed by a blanket
or canvas hung from the upper edge. Rents were high and
any shelter at all was valuable.

From time to time, as progress of the line demanded, the
official terminus was moved on. From Grand Island it jumped
to North Platte, then to Julesburg, then to Cheyenne, and so
on, in some cases leaving a permanent town of considerable
proportions behind. In the case of Cheyenne a city of five
thousand sprang out of nothing, and there were three newspapers;
but in some instances the advance left behind only a
wreck looking as if a tornado had swept that way. Remnants
of old clothes, boards, straw, broken furniture, thousands of
tin cans, empty bottles, etc., strewed the ground in all directions.
At Green River a number of adobe houses were built,
the ruins of which were still standing at the time of my first
visit to that locality in 1871. Even two or three miles up the

track I found dugouts and a large amount of wreckage to remind
one of the late "prosperity." The life at these places
had all the most vicious
qualities of our civilization,
and few of its good
ones. There were no
policemen, and the state
of disorder may be imagined.
It was a feverish
nightmare of horrors, in striking contrast to the sobriety of the
life the Mormons brought to the Wilderness.

<p>
Three years after the beginning of the great work, which it
was thought would require ten, the day came when the ceremony
was to be performed that should complete the engineering
triumph. On May 10, 1869, two engines at Promontory
Point, Utah, were brought head to head, a half-world at each
back, as Bret Harte said, only a small space intervening, where
the crowd gathered to witness the driving of the last spike
which should bring far seas together and mark an end and a
beginning. There was a prayer by the Reverend Doctor Todd.
The last tie, of California laurel, beautifully polished and bearing
on one side a silver plate with names of officers engraved
upon it, was then laid. Two rails were next placed opposite
each other, one for the Union, the other for the Central
Pacific. Following this was a presentation of spikes on the
part of California, Nevada, and Arizona. Governor Stanford
responded for the Central Pacific, and General Dodge for the
Union Pacific. With a silver hammer for driving the last
spike, presented by the Union Express Company, Governor
Stanford stood on the south rail, while Dr. Durant, to drive
another, stood on the north one. At a signal that the telegraph
was ready these spikes were driven, the last one, the
golden spike of the Central Pacific, being connected with the
telegraph so that the strokes of Stanford's hammer were repeated
all over the country, and at the final blow "done" was
sent to the waiting world. The crowd cheered; Dr. Durant
and Governor Stanford shook hands. Telegrams of congratulation
were received. General Dodge, the engineer in chief,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_337' name='Page_337' href='#Page_337'>337</a></span>
and Jack and Dan Casement, the chief contractors, were the
heroes of the hour. The work was finished.

<p>
The operation of building this line partly belongs to the
romantic period of Breaking the Wilderness, but when that last
spike of gold was sent home and the engines met
upon the rails a new and different epoch began.
Scarcely less fascinating, up to this moment, have
been its events, but this volume is not for them.
The trail of the iron horse, which would annihilate
the vast distances of the Wilderness, where
the life blood of so many had softened the way,
was an accomplished fact. The new era was at
hand. Europe and Cathay stood at last face to
face, in the midst of that once "northern
mystery" which was the dream of the gold-hunting
<i><span lang="es_ES">conquistadore</span></i>. The Seven Cities of
Cibola had long ago vanished, but the rich cities
of the Republic were building in their place, and wealth beyond
the wildest imagination of the early adventurers was
now to flow from every corner of the broken Wilderness.

certain tribes of similar culture and village habits once lived. These seem to have
been of different stocks, exactly as the village building tribes of to-day are. Some
were probably Shoshonean, some Piman, others were allied to the Tañoan and
Keresan, while still others were of stocks now extinct. For all these the term
Puebloan is convenient.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_41'>[41]</a></span> Some years ago, in a <i>Bulletin of the American Geographical Society</i> (1897), I

matter somewhat clearer, especially as to the site of Tiguex, and gave my ideas
before the meeting of the International Congress of Americanists, 13th Session,
New York, 1902. Simpson, before me, located Tiguex below the mouth of the
Puerco, and it can be nowhere else.

Mo., and two miles from the river, a silver-plated halberd, together with
some old French and Spanish coins. The articles were six feet below the surface,
and were exposed by the cutting of a creek. Later owned by Mr. Jo. A. Wilson
of Lexington. This halberd does not indicate Coronado's presence, but it is interesting
in this connection. The French coins would suggest a later time—dates
not known.

"As graphic and as interesting as a novel.... Of especial value
to the average reader is the multiplicity of pictures. They occur on
almost every page, and while the text is always clear, these pictures
give, from a single glance, an idea of the vastness of the canyons and
their remarkable formation, which it would be beyond the power of
pen to describe. And the color reproduction of the water-color drawing
that Thomas Moran made of the entrance to Bright Angel Trail
gives some faint idea of the glories of color which have made the
Grand Canyon the wonder and the admiration of the world."—<i>The
Cleveland Leader.</i>

<p>
"His scientific training, his long experience in this region, and his
eye for natural scenery enable him to make this account of the Colorado
River most graphic and interesting. No other book equally
good can be written for many years to come—not until our knowledge
of the river is greatly enlarged."—<i>The Boston Herald.</i>

<p>
Mr. Dellenbaugh's new book is a narrative of the United States
Exploring Expedition, generally known as the Second Powell Expedition
down the Green and Colorado Rivers from Wyoming almost
forty years ago; an expedition which in all these years never has
been described in any government publication, nor by anyone
in print excepting Mr. Dellenbaugh, who was a member of the
party. Yet it was the expedition to make the first maps of the
course of the river and of some of the contiguous country. In the
<i>Romance of the Colorado</i>, Mr. Dellenbaugh gave a brief description
of this expedition in order to make his history of the remarkable
river complete, but now feeling the desirability of a fuller record
in the interest of Western United States history, he tells, in <i>A
Canyon Voyage</i>, the whole experience.

An interesting description from a fresh point of
view of the international struggle which ended
with the English conquest of the Ohio Basin, and
includes many interesting details of the pioneer movement
on the Ohio. The most widely read students of the Ohio
Valley will find a unique and unexpected interest in Mr.
Hulbert's chapters dealing with the Ohio River in the
Revolution, the rise of the cities of Pittsburg, Cincinnati,
and Louisville, the fighting Virginians, the old-time
methods of navigation, etc. The work presents in a consecutive
narrative the most important historic incidents
connected with the river, combined with descriptions of
some of its most picturesque scenery and delightful
excursions into its legendary lore.
